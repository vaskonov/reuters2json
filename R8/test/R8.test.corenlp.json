            "TITLE": "ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT",
            "AUTHOR": "    By William Kazer, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    HONG KONG, April 8 - ",
            "BODY": "Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said. They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes. \"We wouldn't be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MC.T>. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <James Capel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest. \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports. \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter,\" Button said. He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy. The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year. They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.

The paper blamed the waste on inadequate storage and bad preservation methods. It said the government had launched a national programme to reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and preservation, and greater production of additives.

The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said. The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration Commission today. Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said. The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws. The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of each shift and then to walk off. Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with container movements most affected, but has not stopped altogether, they said. They said they could not say how long the disruption will go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements. "

            "TITLE": "SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER",
            "AUTHOR": "    By Linda Sieg, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, April 8 - ",
            "BODY": "Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> is certain to lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said. Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position. \"We'll be back in position in first place within three years,\" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves. \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other. \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities. \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo. The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary. \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,\" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said Kleinwort's Smithson. \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong.\" "

Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices. Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985. Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year. Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's <CMB.N> subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking. "

But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. \"I have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation,\" Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market forces. \"The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time,\" he said. Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here. He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. U.S. Officials said this week's talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs. "

It named no sources. A Nippon Steel spokesman told Reuters that China has made no such official request, and the company was not considering such sales at the moment. But Mainichi quoted Nippon Steel officials as saying if prices are reasonable, they would export their used mills to China. The paper said China's crude steel output totalled 52 mln tonnes in calendar 1986 and that it plans to increase to 80 mln by 1996. Japan's steel industry rationalisation plan is aimed at cutting production capacity sharply over the next few years. "

A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded capital. Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray Astin, that the listings of new \"B\" shares would be barred. The official announcement said this will include the proposal by Jardine Matheson. But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying: \"We continue to believe that the issuing of \"B\" shares would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage.\" Keswick said the \"B\" share issue will benefit Jardine Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting existing shareholders' voting rights. However, he added: \"We certainly welcome (the Secretary for Monetary Affairs) David Nendick's referral of this very important matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law Reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the development of general principles which can be embraced by all constituents of the Hong Kong market.\" "

            "BODY": "A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) <SANM.MN> to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said. A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of fiduciary duties.\" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company's board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company's board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary <Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board meeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15. \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in a statement. \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco's court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial.\" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which are available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the <A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June. \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz told Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\" The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders' meeting, scheduled for May 14. San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985. "

The Stauffer sale prospectus has been sent in recent weeks to a number of companies expressing interest. The Unilever spokesman declined to say how much the group expected to receive for Stauffer.

Nine month sales to September 1986 were about 1.2 billion dlrs. Unilever aquired Chesebrough for 3.2 billion dlrs in order to benefit from its well-known toiletry brands and food products. "

Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies. Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce this year. The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction against the redundancies on procedural grounds. The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future. Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the sector, said. The employers have written to the union asking it to reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been called for tomorrow. "

            "BODY": "Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,\" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year. "

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 22. U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue, but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of \"the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.\" Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs. Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments. The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.

            "BODY": "West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels. But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners. \"There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,\" he said. \"We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a \"slight firming\" of the yen against the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar. \"The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,\" he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation. \"And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress,\" he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis. \"You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,\" he said. "

In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share. Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market conditions and improved operations. \"The combination of capital improvement programs and more employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper operations,\" Roberts said. He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle of the year. Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986. "

A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the company's new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. \"Anything else would be more than a surprise,\" one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985. "

Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.

Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.

Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said. "

In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. \"Many other markets maintain restrictions,\" he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. \"Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage,\" he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said. Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said. The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division. In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said. Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly created position of president of Agrimont. Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing director of <Eridania SPA> and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing director of <Italiana Olii e Sifi>, both of whom are members of the the Ferruzzi Group's management board, to Argimont's board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison, the company said. "

            "DATELINE": "    New York, April 8 - ",
            "BODY": "The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just \"rumors.\" Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer has been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. \"There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning they've done,\" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. \"They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\" said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. \"In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make,\" she said. \"You look at their record over the year, and I think they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past,\" Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. \"After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people don't find him very credible anymore,\" said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesn't win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens <STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc <FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc <WPM> rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8. "

            "AUTHOR": "    By Robert Trautman, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 8 - ",
            "BODY": "Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade.\" Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders. \"The United States has excessive expectations.,\" he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\" He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

            "AUTHOR": "    By Emma Robson, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    AMSTERDAM, April 8 - ",
            "BODY": "Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration. Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El Aguila S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said. Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized. Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term. He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money. "

A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute and an agreement on this issue would effect the security, economy and other rights of both countries. \"As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations,\" the statement said. Greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the International Court of Justice. The two countries approached armed confrontation last month after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil. A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to territorrial waters. \"The latest crises created an historic opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,\" the Foreign Ministry statement said. Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal. The contents of the message were not disclosed. "

            "BODY": "Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30, 1988. At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs. In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs, or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs. Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line. Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988. He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its businesses and not in its dividends. \"Shareholders are better off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends or share repurchases,\" he said. Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988, from 40 pct in fiscal 1987. He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will double that by 1995. Wallin said, \"Our objective is to get a hold of new products and start building market share if we have to beg, borrow or steal to get into new markets.\" In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and a needless overprescription of pacemakers. \"We have no knowledge of any major problems in our pacemakers or leads,\" Wallin said. \"We intend to re-establish our company as the quality leader in the industry.\" Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said the company intends to diversify internally and through acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise, such as drug delivery systems. Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does not include dilutions from acquisitions. \"We hope to have some safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions from an acquisition.\" Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988. The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical activity. Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a rate responsive pacemaker. "

He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well. But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988 should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the contribution of the new Atlantic City facility. Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third quarter. For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs. Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest as it had been able to do previously. Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming was completed earlier in the week. "

Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings, Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share reported for the first quarter of 1986. The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador. Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20. Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since February. In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the country's export revenues. In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record interest income only as it is received in cash. The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume later in 1987. The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.

Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three divisions attacked. The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery and tanks. \"Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge the last foothold\" occupied by the Iranians, it said. (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000 Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.) The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot down. Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to attack an offshore terminal, the communique said. "

The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for 2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt. Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also held discussions with its chairman. The developer indicated in those talks that he took the position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans. Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2 mln shares. \"United has got to consider this proposal. I think the pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it, but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL management,\" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst. Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a strategy to become a travel service company. The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention on its airline. UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one. But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100 dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe the stock is in play. Market sources have said that although Trump attracted attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps throwing the company into the hands of another buyer. \"The first domino is you have an investor with a considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,\" said Pettee. \"What's interesting is the values are there. There's something for everybody,\" he said. "

Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any of its divisions. He added, \"We have the financial capacity to take advantage of acquisitions.\" In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10 redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta, Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.

There was no sign, however, of the Italian delegation whose position was thrown into question this morning by the resignation of the Christian Democratic wing of Italy's Socialist-led government. European monetary officials said later that the Italian delegation was inside the building. This meant that a full blown meeting of the Group of Seven was in progress. "

The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on March nine set April nine as the target date for completing negotiations. However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached. The two companies said they \"now plan to complete work by April 23.\" Chrysler and Renault said, \"Given the complex nature of the deal, the need for additional time was to be expected.\" The March letter of intent between the two companies says that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date \"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence' investigation of the company,\" referring to American Motors. A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's statement that more time was needed because the talks are complex. \"That is our definition of the delay,\" she said. Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault, their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend by a written agreement by both companies. The Chrysler spokeswoman said, \"We are still working toward a definitive agreement.\" Said another Chrysler official who is not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in trouble: \"There are no glitches.\" Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. \"I can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done,\" said Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

General Electric also attibuted continued strong performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter. GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624 mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or 1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago. General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results are in line with those expectations. General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for its strong earnings. It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike. Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said. In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products. General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after taxes from an inventory accounting change. And technical products revenues and operating profit were ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's communications and related services.

The schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.

As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy. \"On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down,\" Wojnilower said in a report. \"Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear,\" Wojnilower said. He said last week's \"hiccup\" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts. Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said. "

Short term refers to 1987 and 1988, the spokesman said. He declined to elaborate. IAE's other owners are Rolls Royce PLC, <Japanese Aero Engines Corp>, Fiat SPA and <MTU> of West Germany. Analysts are estimating United Technologies will earn 3.75 dlrs to 4.50 dlrs a share in 1987. It reported earnings of 36 cts a share in 1986, which included two large writeoffs. "

Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in 1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46 billion in 1985. In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07 dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year. The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of changes tariff and federal tax rates. The company's gas marketing business is expected to have somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year. Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a 2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not be profitable until late 1988, Williams said. "

            "BODY": "Hawkeye Bancorp's 1986 annual financial results were qualified by its auditors, according to the annual report. \"...there are conditions which may indicate that the company will be unable to continue as a going concern,\" auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual report to shareholders. Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs. However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986 year end, said it expects \"to have sufficient cash to meet its obligations for the next 12-month period.\" Last July the bank holding company reached a debt restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries and five non-bank operations for disposition. \"The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to survive as a going concern,\" the report said. Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory agreements and on its ability to return to profitable operations, it said. There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meet these requirements. However, the company \"believes it will be able to do so,\" Hawkeye said. "

Dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose debt is secured by Dome's Encor shares. After the five years are up, \"under certain circumstances the shares of Encor may be required to be disposed,\" the company said. Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, estimated last year at 947 mln dlrs. Analysts have said Commerce Bank was pressing Dome to sell the stock to pay down its debt. Dome's Encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on March 17, 1987, the company's filing said. As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987. Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the interim debt plan, due to expire on June 30, and winning agreement for its proposed restructuring plan. \"The company believes that the negotiation and implementation of the proposed debt restructuring plan is realistic and achievable,\" Dome said. \"However, the final outcome of the negotiations cannot be predicted at this time,\" it said.

            "AUTHOR": "    By Irwin Arieff",
            "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 8 - ",
            "BODY": "Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy. The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs. Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year. \"In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit,\" said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst. \"At best, it will have a small positive effect,\" Collander said in an interview. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar. The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger. Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit. In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels. As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit. The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending. \"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States. Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession. Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none. But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets. \"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters. The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems. The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end. In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget. On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs. \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\" Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels. \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street.\" The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year. The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts. "

They said they were looking for an acquisition. It doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one,\" said Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co. American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been speculating that American Brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco. \"This is just typical,\" said George Thompson of Prudential-Bache securities. \"There's going to be more to come here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,\" he said. cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the type of acquisition they envisioned. \"The distilled spirits business has been in a steady gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,\" said Thompson.

            "BODY": "Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said. Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates. Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation. But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate. It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said. Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell. \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity.\" Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average, and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.

Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln. RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in oil prices. Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned subsidiaries RTZ Borax Ltd, RTZ Cement Ltd, RTZ Chemicals Ltd and RTZ Pillar Ltd.

            "BODY": "The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co <PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters. Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the company's common stock from 10 to five pesos. He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18 mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15 1987. \"The exercise should make our stock more marketable,\" Lazo said. \"Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors.\" PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February 1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila Stock Exchange. Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15, would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15. PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68 pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985. At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders. A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax from which it was previously exempt. The government has not so far ordered the implementation of the tax decision. PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014 telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments in the country. In Manila item \"Philippine Telephone firm plans stock split\" please read in page 3, first para, \"the company's profits are likely to be substantially cut\" (inserting dropped word). This replaces \"the company's profits are likely to be substantial\" "

Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets, planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad. Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the Socialists in 1982. The sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch. So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation. The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday. \"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,\" CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters. Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation at between four and five billion francs. De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least the same number of investors as <Sogenal>, another recently privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares. The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also included the sale of Saint-Gobain <SGEP.PA>, and Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA>. The sale of <Banque du Batiment et des Travaux Publics> and <Banque Industrielle et Mobiliere Privee> should be completed this month, while third largest French bank Societe Generale <SGEN.PA> will be privatised later this year.

Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S. The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices. Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese. The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified. The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S. And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged access to the Japanese market. "

            "BODY": "Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth. In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a \"good meeting\" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said, \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.\" It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed \"extraordinary and urgent measures\" including an \"unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.\" The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate. It said the officials \"reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\" "

            "BODY": "Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS> reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits for 1987. Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague. In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat. Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group's profits. AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp. AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before. "

            "BODY": "Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve. At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental. \"As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea,\" he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement. Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks. The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago. "

The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share. It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of chief executive officer. Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C. Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City. It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line. The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at the end of any 30 day period. Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force to independent representatives and dealers from employees to \"significantly reduce its fixed overhead.\" Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be affected by the move. The company said Lane will become an independent dealter for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue to serve as a director, it added. "

Hutton LBO Inc said the tender offer by its wholly owned unit, PC Acquisition Inc, for Purolator Courier Corp <PCC> expired at 2400 EDT yesterday without the purchase of any Purolator common stock. Hutton added that PC Acquisition also terminated its merger agreement with Purolator. Hutton said the offer, which had been conditioned upon the tender of at least 5,116,892 Purolator shares, or about two-thirds of the outstanding shares, was terminated because the minimum number of shares was not tendered. Purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with PC Acquisition, part-owned by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of E.F. Hutton, and some officers of Purolator's U.S. courier division, in which PC offered to purchase 6,332,471 Purolator common stock shares for 35 dlrs a share. Following that move, PC Acquisition planned to merge a subsidiary into Purolator, converting all outstanding Purolator common it did not own into an aggregate 46 mln dlrs principal amount of 12 pct guaranteed debentures due 2002 and warrants to purchase 15 pct of a Purolator unit comprised of Purolator's U.S courier operations. Hutton said as of 2400 EDT yesterday about 181,000 shares of Purolator common stock, or about 2.4 pct of the outstanding shares, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn. PC Acquisition has instructed its depository for the offer to return promptly the Purolator stock deposited by, or on behalf of, tendering shareholders, Hutton said. "

The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all shares. Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any specific takeover attempt. Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one share of the company's common stock. The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result in 20 pct ownership, the company said. Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in connection with certain transactions afterward. The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1, 1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said. Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed to stockholders. "

            "BODY": "Losses for Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said. The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an \"upper limit.\" VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company. VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks. "

            "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 9 - ",
            "BODY": "Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability. Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene \"as and when necessary.\" He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament. \"If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk,\" he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, \"If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States.\" Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit. \"We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year,\" Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, \"I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\" Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant.\" He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that \"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been \"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing,\" he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.

            "BODY": "Treasury Secretary James Baker said that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels. In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have \"now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.\" Baker said, \"These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels.\" As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances \"simply are not sustainable,\" Baker told the ministers. He said that the Reagan administration was resisting \"strong domestic pressure\" for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill. \"While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist,\" he said. Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall. \"We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary,\" he said.

National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance of orders. \"I think the sales price was higher than most people expected,\" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group. A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts per share last year, including the spirits and wine business \"They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That will ease their interest cost burden,\" said Henry. National Distillers sold its wine business last month to Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs. Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor businesses. Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year. National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine businesses, moving more into the chemical area. For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was 67 cts per share. "

Earlier it posted net income for the period of 14.7 mln dlrs or 87 cts a share, up from 11.7 mln dlrs or 73 cts a share. Total nonperforming assets were 114.1 mln dlrs at March 31, up from 53.4 mln dlrs at December 31 and 79 mln dlrs at March 31, 1986 the bank said. The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago. Net loan charge offs were six mln dlrs, down from 11 mln dlrs a year ago. The reserve for loan losses was 78.1 mln dlrs, or two pct of outstanding loans, higher than the 56 mln dlrs of 1.65 pct of loans outstanding at March 31, 1986. "

            "DATELINE": "    OTTAWA, April 9 - ",
            "BODY": "Canada's trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year. The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally. \"Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,\" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year. \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month. \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in its monthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs. Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. \"We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland's Donegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn. Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is probably transitory.\" "

The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half price. Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board approval.

Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker. The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face value of 70 dlrs, and a \"contingent payment certificate\" that would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each share of Holly Sugar outstanding. The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of 12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC. Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions. \"Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel, we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal, including price,\" it said in its April 8 letter.

Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977. \"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990. \"However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction,\" Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. \"An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.

Industry sources told Reuters yesterday that Fundamental was close to acquiring the government securities brokerage division of MKI, a major broker of corporate bonds. Fundamental said it intends to use the facilities formerly used by MKI to provide a new block brokering service in the most active Treasury issues. By separating the execution of wholesale trades from the heavy volume of smaller lots, large-scale transactions will be facilitated, the company said. \"The new system is expected to substantially enhance the liquidity and effiency of markets,\" Fundamental said. The wholesale brokering service will begin on or around April 20. "

The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S. relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly gasoline, and support from crude oil prices. Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or three pct from the previous week. In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to 19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct. Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct. But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices. Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of 68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week. For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs. On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A. also jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82 dlrs on higher gasoline prices. "

            "BODY": "Treasury Secretary James Baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy. In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned. \"But I do suggest,\" he said, \"that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts.\" He said that indicators can serve \"as a kind of compass\" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies. Baker, however, said the IMF \"needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today.\" The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public. \"In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures,\" he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device \"for moving beyond rhetoric to action.\" He said they provide \"more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination.\" He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. \"This should be matter of priority for the executive board,\" he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that \"can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options.\" He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. \"If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables,\" he said.

Keith Goodrich said. \"We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from continuing operations,\" he told reporters after the annual meeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year's lost ground and reach 1985 results. In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to 139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations. Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for acquisitions related to its core areas of business forms manufacturing or handling. \"We could do a large acquisition,\" he said when asked if the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this purpose. Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to pursue an acquisition. \"If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can move with a certain expediency,\" Sinclair said. Asked if the resolution was designed to give Moore protection from a possible hostile takeover, Sinclair said only, \"I know of no threat to the corporation at this time.\" "

            "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 9 - ",
            "BODY": "Bank of Japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate. They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span, not the currency's recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said. In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources said. Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening, they said. "

But some unions, including those of building and mining workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would continue their strikes for a few more days. State officials said the government had agreed to revise its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly higher cash benefits for injured workers. Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers' compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of the compromise package are not yet known. The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales unless the government modified its pending legislation on the issue. State officials said the only sectors affected in the past three days were some government building projects, railway freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports. "

Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific. About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said. Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake. The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco. The government estimates it will take about four more months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return output to normal levels, the spokesman said. "

Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week. However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday. Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods. Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.

            "DATELINE": "    TAIPEI, April 11 - ",
            "BODY": "Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States. Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington. \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,\" he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei. Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show. Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials. The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with \"a heavy heart,\" meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada. Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property. \"I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.,\" he said without elaborating.

At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed. \"I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very clearly, and it has been clearly understood.\" Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain. \"It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing them to carry out other kinds.\" \"I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use them.\" He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship. \"I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets.\" On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case. He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said. Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners. Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened.

            "DATELINE": "    HOUSTON, April 13 - ",
            "BODY": "Texaco Inc <TX> said its decision to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code will not affect the majority of its businesses. It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its 32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property, plant and equipment, were free of the action. Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are affected, it said. But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs. Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>. Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985 judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY>. The bond almost matches the damages awarded against Texaco. Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin to attach its assets to secure the judgment. Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to the Texas courts. Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of the Pennzoil lawsuit. \"Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond issue and the larger dispute failed,\" James Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive officer, told reporters. Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11. Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not sell any assets, Kinnear said. Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under 11.1 billion dlrs, he added. Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for bankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies. \"Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go to bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said. Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full. "

The issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said. The bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged capital at about the level of its last full year ended September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln dlrs in all for that year. Shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the bank's articles of association to allow it to offer shares in lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the market price. The group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue ahead of dividend imputation, effective July 1. "

            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 12 - ",
            "BODY": "A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer. "

            "AUTHOR": "    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, April 13 - ",
            "BODY": "Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London, because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However, British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport, and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action. One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam, they point out. "

Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in the U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half. Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one mln stg, it noted. Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results were nonetheless disappointing. Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders. Morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 GMT from 316p at Friday's close. "

            "BODY": "Borg-Warner <BOR> Corp, facing an unwanted offer from GAF Corp <GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by <Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc>. Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the new company, <AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of Borg-Warner common stock. The offer will be followed by a merger in which each remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and 54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated discount debentures. As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said members of management do not plan to participate in the transaction, but they will retain their positions with the company. A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares. GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share. Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and speculated an offer would have to be sweetened. In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co. James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, said, \"We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its strong presence in the Chicago community.\" Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer, which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing arrangements. The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or 51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered. Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments. Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the financing required to complete the transaction. The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying cash interest after five years. The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at 102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount. The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before maturity. Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50 dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock. The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right, effective immediately. "

            "DATELINE": "    TORONTO, April 13 - ",
            "BODY": "A takeover battle began today for debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> as TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers. Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A> which is 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON.N>, <PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd> which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd <CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>. Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another proposal from \"a substantial company\" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a statement. The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid, but did not identify the companies involved in talks. TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders. Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada, totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs. Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement \"violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers\" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals. It said the TransCanada bid \"seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments.\" But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals. TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. \"I find (Dome's statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce it,\" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the other bidders, or the terms of other offers. Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at 5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981. "

The traders estimated the surplus today at about 1,800 billion yen.

If after a party acquired 20 pct or more of its stock Crazy Eddie were acquired or 50 pct of its earnings power or assets sold, rightholders other than the acquirer would be entitled to buy shares of the acquirer's common stock worth twice the rights' exercise price, the company said. Crazy Eddie said if a party were to acquire 30 pct or more of its common stock and then fail to acquire Crazy Eddie within 180 days thereafter, rightholders would be entitled to exchange their Crazy Eddie common stock for subordinated notes of Crazy Eddie maturing either one year or, above a certain dollar limt, five years after issuance. Crazy Eddie said adoption of the plan is not in response to any known effort to acquire control of it.

Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. \"You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus, enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation there,\" he said. Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told the same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not fallen enough against the currencies of some countries. \"I think that more does have to be done there in negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs (newly industrialized countries),\" he said. Darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized countries were underway privately. Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agree on a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22 billion dlrs in new revenues. The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would be considered by Congress, including an extension of the telephone tax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes. Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that it would not happen without President Reagan's support. Darman called for a \"top level negotiation\" between the White House and Congress on a budget compromise that would include asset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-class entitlement programs, \"a reasonable, steady rate of growth in defense\" and reform of the budget process.

            "AUTHOR": "    By Larry Welsh, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 13 - ",
            "BODY": "A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer. "

            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 13 - ",
            "BODY": "Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned. In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he had received a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to the offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a primary basis. Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in June. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln dlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a merger transaction. Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns, would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis. He said he still has received only a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to his tender. In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April 8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to increase the price of his offer. Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in place. Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> has now delivered to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition. He said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, which leads a syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the purchase of shares under the offer. Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender, each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer, or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an independent investment baking firm. He said \"To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.\" Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to Caesars' recapitalization. Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory process required for regulatory approval, a process that it already underway in New Jersey. He said his offer has been extended based on the likely duration of the regulatory process. He said he intends to further extend the offer if the approval process is not completed by the expiration date. "

Goodyear said it will report first quarter results April 27. Goodyear chairman Robert E. Mercer also told the annual meeting that unless there is a major downturn in the economy, it expects to work its debt down to normal levels in three years through its restructuring and cash flow from improved margins. The company set up its restructuring program to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by Sir James Goldsmith. As part of the restructuring, Goodyear executed a major stock buyback program that resulted in an increase in its debt. "

Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February.

They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides. The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are \"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.\" Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese exports. The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action. They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves. In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods. Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March. "

The plan, along with a proposal to change its name to Cooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at the company's annual meeting on June 22. The meeting had been postponed from its original date of May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization options, it said. In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and its year ago quarter. Income from continuing operations was not immediately availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs. At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference, Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for shareholders. He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35 dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his position. \"The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold his position and has never recovered,\" Montgomery said. The company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4. Montgomery further told the conference, \"Don't be an investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988.\" \"Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of the impact to the bottom line,\" he said.

It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of six mln shares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and Pentland will sell 1,404,866 shares, reducing its stake in Reebok to 18.1 mln from 19.5 mln shares. After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares outstanding. Pentland said the amount of the capital gain from the sale depends on the offering price for the Reebok shares to be negotiated between it, Reebok, and the other selling stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok common, and the underwriters. Pentland said proceeds from the offering will be used by Reebok to retire bank debt incurred in its acquisition of AVIA Group for about 180 mln dlrs. Is said that afterwards, Reebok will have bank credit lines available for general corporate purposes, including possible acquisitions. Reebok's stock was selling at 45-1/2, up 1/8. At that price, the 1.4 mln Reebok shares Pentland will sell are worth about 64 mln dlrs and the three mln shares Reebok will sell are worth about 136.5 mln dlrs. Pentland said it will use proceeds to fund growth and possible acquisitions. Pentland said 4,500,000 shares of Rebbok will be offered in the U.S. by a syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc and 1,500,000 shares will be offered outside the U.S. by an international syndicate led by Kidder. It said the U.S. underwriters have been granted an option to buy from certain selling stockholders up to an additional 900,000 shares to cover overallotments. Pentland said it has not chosen to participate in this over allotment. Pentland said that as soon as the date and price of the offering have been determined it will release further details. It said it expects the offering to close in May. "

The sale excludes certain real estate assets of Joske's and Cain-Sloan, which Allied estimates have an aggregate value of 30 mln dlrs based on current market conditions. Joske's has 26 stores in Texas and one in Arizona. Cain-Sloan has four stores in Nashville. Joske's is the largest unit Allied has slated for sale in its restructuring. Allied Stores Corp, a subsidiary of Campeau Corp, was acquired by acquired by the Canadian developer last year. Robert Campeau, chairman of Allied, said \"this is a terrific start to our disposition program which is proceeding well ahead of schedule. This sale will fulfill the requirements under our bank agreements to sell certain assets by June 30 and give us additional flexibility in the disposal of the remaining divisions being sold.\" Allied Stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt by June 30. There had been some doubts on Wall Street that the company could meet the payment. A Campeau source said, \"We believe this cash sale puts us in a very strong negotiating position to maximize the proceeds Allied can receive from its other divisions.\" \"Allied was able to put itself in a position where it knows it will be able to meet the June 30 payment schedules,\" the source said. About 1.1 bilion dlrs in Allied assets had been targeted for sale by Dec. 31, 1988 to pay for the aquisition of Allied by Campeau. Allied will be taking bids for its other divisions. Targeted for sale are Bonwit Tellers, Garfinckel's, Dey's, Donaldson's, Herpolsheimer's, Heer's, Miller's, Miller and Rhoads, Pomeroy's, Catherine's, Plymouth Shops, and Jerry Leonard. The divisions provided 38.4 pct of Allied net sales and 11.8 pct of store profit in fiscal 1985. "

Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not know the names of the president and controller, and could not immediately comment on the release. Foster said the amount involved in the \"discrepancy\" is about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net after tax due to an \"improper recording of job costs over a period of several years and continuing through part of the first quarter of 1987.\" Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary. The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not \"likely to be significant\" but the amount to be charged to prior periods had not been determined. Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively. Stearns, based in Crowley, Texas, makes airport baggage conveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges. Foster, a diversified international concern with 27 subsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in Livingston, New Jersey. Its reported revenues for the period ended December 26, 1986 of 1.3 billion dlrs. The company said a detailed audit and investigation is continuing.

            "BODY": "Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States. Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington. \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,\" he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei. Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show. Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials. The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with \"a heavy heart,\" meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada. Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property. \"I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.,\" he said without elaborating.

The report said the assessment was based on travel in the two countries from March 30 to April 4. It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged winter temperatures this spring. However, in general plant development was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied greatly by regions, the report said. Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about 65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others varied considerably, the report said. Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said. "

            "BODY": "Chemical New York Corp said its first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed 1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual. Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax. A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities. Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual, Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or 4.3 pct below 1986 earnings. Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs. Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest income by 1.5 mln dlrs. Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from 3.96 pct. This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's cost of funds. Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from 27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs from 26.2 mln. Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5 mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said. The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7 mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with 594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier. Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35 billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of March, 1986. "

            "BODY": "National Westminster Bank USA said higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported a year earlier. The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual. Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with 91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates. Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0 mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986. Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status. The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced by about 4.9 mln dlrs. National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Westminster Bank PLC. "

At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an even dollar to 1.20 dlrs. Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be felt until later in the year. These include the success of IBM's new personal computer line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers, which will begin volume shipments in July. In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will emerge as the year progresses. Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than he has been for nearly a year. \"Although the worldwide economic situation remains unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,\" Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher first-quarter shipments. \"We remain optimistic about the prospects for both the industry and IBM,\" he said. \"Akers was most encouraging,\" said PaineWebber's Smith. A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected first-quarter results, analysts said. \"Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in March,\" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of Washington-based Weil and Associates. Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called the Sierras, \"bailed out the whole quarter,\" Weil said, adding, \"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.\" REUTER... "

            "BODY": "Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status. Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62. Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax. Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on these loans during the remainder of 1987. Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses, although these were partly offset by increased trust income, profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities gains, the bank said. The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from 185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was 21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986. "

MacAndrews and Revlon also said they have reached a settlement with the plaintiff in the pending litigation challenging acquisition of the shares by MacAnrews. The companies said the tender offer and withdrawal rights will expireon Tuesday April 28, unless extended. MacAndrews said it will promptly file revised tender offer material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as dealer-manager for the offer, the companies said. Revlon currently has about 42 mln shares outstanding. The current offer price is about 782 mln dlrs, a company spokesman said, up from the previous offer of 720 mln dlrs. On April 1, MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Ronald Perelman, offered 18.50 dlrs a share for the 63 pct of Revlon shares he did not already own. Since the offer was made over a dozen shareholder lawsuits were brought against Revlon alleging the original offer was too low. But, the companies said these lawsuits have been settled in the amended offer. "

Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange. TransCanada PipeLines was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Dome was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at 1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome as \"awfully optimistic\" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer to the shareholders. TransCanada PipeLines' offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders. However, it proposes issuing new equity in a subsidiary that would operate Dome assets. Current Dome shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary. "

This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported on operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications <UT> in July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of Sprint. Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0 mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago. Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, \"we expect US Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance telecommunications. The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the fraudalent use of the network. Operating income of its telephone operations, which account for 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs. Revenues from telephone operations rose eight pct to 2.9 billion dlrs. "

            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 13 - ",
            "BODY": "GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company. Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for 4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for 89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and securities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. \"I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in with another bid,\" said one analyst, who values the company at 51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's stock. \"You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking at it - that it's worth more,\" Pershing and Co analyst Richard Henderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill Lynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as telephones, computer terminals, and appliances. \"Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical operation these days,\" said Henderson. \"He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he does not like to get pushed around,\" said Henderson. GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its investment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. \"It's a win-win situation,\" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be forthcoming shortly. \"I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this book,\" he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts, protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per share. \"I think there's a probability he goes up in price,\" said Rose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman would do. \"Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.\" \"Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,\" Rose said. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add earnings momentum to GAF. \"I worked out that paying as much as 50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,\" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986 operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986. \"The Borg chemical business is great,\" said Rose, adding its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co <MCT> and Dow Chemical Co <DOW>.

TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP> yesterday bid 4.30 billion dlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks with TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored to be offshore. Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands, Blair replied, \"Yes. I think that we still need to be building as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian management.\" He said he did not know who other possible bidders were. Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house in order \"will remove one of the general problems of attitude that have hung over Western Canadian industry.\" He added, however, that the energy industry still faced \"a couple of tough, tough additional years.\" Asked about Nova's 1987 prospects, Blair predicted that Nova's net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mln dlrs from last year's net profit of 100.2 mln dlrs due to improved product prices and continued cost-cutting.

Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or 79 cts in the same period a year ago. Better operating results in each of the company's three sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said. \"Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our restructuring,\" chairman Edson Spencer said. \"All of our businesses are producing better results than last year, even though we do not see significant improvement in the external market environment,\" he said. Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially, with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said. Domestic industrial automation and control orders were modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said. Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international markets, it said. International orders increased, with the greatest strength in Europe, Honeywell said. The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five mln share buyback program which began in 1986. "

It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. \"The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the European and American markets,\" the daily said. The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details. \"Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew,\" it said. The sources warned that \"maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies,\" it said. \"The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,\" it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts. \"More than one official has warned OPEC would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,\" it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.

The company said the change came after talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement in considering the five mln dlrs collectible. In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible, making its loan loss provision less than required. The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986 was adequate and that it has considered all relevant information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr receivable. But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff would not be in its best interest. "

The company last week had stated that a number of domestic and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether. Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings. Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks told Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P. Morgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits to cover transactions, it said. The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could,\" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies. \"It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an avalanche,\" he said. \"Supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.\" He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton said. It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company, canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards. The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> last week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today said, \"a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on supplying. They had cancelled last week.\" He declined to identify the company. <Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said. But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the Algerians, he added. Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter 11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines and oil supplies that are key to the company's business. \"It will be business as usual for Texaco,\" said Martin Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer and Traub. \"Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,\" he said. \"But when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.\" But other officials at Texaco were not immediately available to say whether discussions were being held with its banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. \"The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from Monday, with activity in the European and American markets,\" it said. The sources were quoted as saying that after Opec had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details. \"Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew,\" it reported. \"The sources warned that maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies. \"The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure Opec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,\" it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts. \"More than one official has warned Opec would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,\" it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.

A GAF spokesman said the company asked for the information in order to enable GAF to fully evaluate its alternatives. The spokesman also confirmed that GAF did raise its bid to 48 dlrs cash from 46 dlrs per share on Friday. Merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of Borg-Warner, and a package of cash and securities for the balance. The transaction with Merrill Lynch will take Borg-Warner private in the form of a leveraged buyout. Merrill Lynch does not intend to sell Borg-Warner assets, but it may be forced to do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the transaction. Borg-Warner has said its management is not a participant in the transaction, but managers will retain their positions. The investors involved with Merrill include pension funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors, sources said. Analysts believe GAF, which owns 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner, will raise its offer. That speculation drove Borg-warner stock up 1-3/8 to 49-5/8 in heavy trading. GAF closed at 49-5/8, off 3/4. "

Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. \"The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,\" he said. \"The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market,\" he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC's most difficult ever but \"a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment.\" He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported. In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products. "

            "DATELINE": "    Toronto, April 13 - ",
            "BODY": "Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the debt-heavy company. Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome has normally moved by only a few cents per day. TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify. Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday stressed that its bid is \"a Canadian solution to the financial difficulties of Dome Petroleum.\" \"The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont <DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadian interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,\" said Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd. David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British Petroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent of Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own. Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said in recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talks with Dome. Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum, Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as \"awfully optimistic,\" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10 dlrs Canadian per common share. Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada would own 80 pct. However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. \"The TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,\" he said. Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is \"at the upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.\" The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87 billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on several years ago when oil prices were high and the company wanted to expand. \"There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,\" Gobert said. Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the heart of Canada's oil industry. Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of land across Canada. The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of 2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the largest ever by a Canadian company. "

Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies under the bankruptcy filing. However, others were less worried. \"The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry,\" one New York trader said. \"If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,\" he added. Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.

Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco on an open line basis, he said. Another trader, however, described today's activity as business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in bankruptcy. Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins for Texaco's trades. New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for companies that are in financial trouble.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30 mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed. But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct. The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer manager services or for break-up of the deal. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock. The company's board has approved the plan, which was intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp. Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities, if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said it was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it was conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in the tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their positions. But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130 mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of subordinated discount debentures. GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash. "

CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia. Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao. It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor. To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco. The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said. "

Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, which holds a 20 pct share in IDC, has opposed plans to merge with rival group, <International Telecom Japan Inc>. Under the plan, backed by the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, Cable and Wireless and U.S.-based <Pacific Telesis International Inc> would become core companies in the merged firm, with shares equal to those of the six major Japanese core companies and seats on the board of directors. Britain, angry over what it feels are moves to restrict Cable and Wireless' role in the sector, views the issue as a test case. The IDC official declined to specify what was holding up the talks. A spokesman for C. Itoh and Co Ltd <CITT.T>, which holds 20 pct of IDC, said a meeting may be held later this week. "

            "AUTHOR": "    By Linda Sieg, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, April 17 - ",
            "BODY": "Basic reform of Japan's protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus, securities analysts said. The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they said. \"In economic terms, reform would be a plus,\" said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co. The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S., The analysts said. Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew. Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth, it added. \"There's a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo said. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\" Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted. Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending, economists said. \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor at Kyoto Gakuen University. Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations told a recent press conference. External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan. But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said. Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders. The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon, the analysts said. Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security, they said. Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity, they said. Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew. "

            "BODY": "President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade. The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\" He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday: \"we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.\" Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up. U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States. "

            "BODY": "Amoco Corp is apparently the successful bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a published report. The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were available and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco had emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and Mail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused to identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and Exxon Corp's <XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in Canada. British Petroleum PLC <BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada, the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and officials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs, analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company, with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp. "

Ten pct of the shares have been reserved for employees, who get a five pct discount increased to 20 pct if they keep the shares for two years. Employees also get one free share for each one bought, if the shares are held for at least one year. Small investors would receive one free share for every 10 bought, with an upper limit of five free shares per investor, and on condition the shares are held for at least 18 months. The state-owned capital of BIMP comprises 2.51 mln shares. The bank is being sold to the public as part of a sweeping programme to privatise 65 state-owned groups over five years.

            "BODY": "White House Budget chief James Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might \"overreact\" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession next year. \"Our greatest danger is overreaction,\" Miller told newspaper reporters yesterday. \"I'm concerned about the Fed's overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data showing a substantial fall in the money supply.\" Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published in the New York Times today, were accurate. Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he said could have \"political consequences.\" The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential and congressional elections next year. \"My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep soup, and there is no question about it,\" he said. Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and a widening of the budget deficit. Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of bolstering the dollar. Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects. U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist pressures in the United States.

            "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned. Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports, he said \"slim to none.\" Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products. Yeutter, on the NBC program \"Today,\" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement. He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance. Asked how long that would take, he said \"We want to see a pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks.\" Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers. He said he did not think Japan would retaliate. \"It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict. The Japanese understand that full well,\" Yeutter said. He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but \"that's more of a paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any adverse impact on U.S. trade.\" Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a major issue, would be productive but \"I don't see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit.\" "

            "BODY": "The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday. The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a \"customs value\" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports. Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis. A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward. The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously. \"My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's legislation that requires us to delay it two days,\" said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs. \"But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure.\" The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs. The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979. Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis. The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration. Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures. \"We're considering it,\" he said, \"It's one of those dinosaur laws and I think it's time has come.\" The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.

The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed. In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a \"serious signal\" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices. Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said. Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit. The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would. The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America's overall deficit. But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all. Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret that these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets. \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara. He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement. U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade. The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn't done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice.\" The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws.\" But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue. \"It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he said, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade.\" Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress.\" He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\" But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use. Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

Earlier today, Reagan imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade. Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back. \"If they (Japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on something like American agricultural products,\" he said. \"But I really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none,\" he added.

The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline, Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said. The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September. \"The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years, with possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,\" Perry said. Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year. The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the Pacific port of Tumaco. Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was \"insignificant compared with what we are going to earn.\" OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln dlrs per month, Espinosa said. "

            "BODY": "The use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government study said. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said, such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms. \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said. The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand. Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers, added little to the problem, it said. \"Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit,\" the study said. \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\" the FTC study said. Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s. It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign consumer demand. The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations. In each case, the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit. "

            "BODY": "The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said. The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher, with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct. There were few offers in a tight market and traders scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct but there was little activity at the longer end of the market. Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf. The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut in the dinar exchange rate. Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from 0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that celebrated the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. "

            "BODY": "Crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen. Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. \"Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago,\" he said. He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels. The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output. \"I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions,\" Lajous said. A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is always there as a possibility, he said. \"I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained,\" he said. Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control. He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output, were \"very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer.\" "

Spectra-Physics said it also filed a lawsuit in Delaware federal court this morning seeking to enjoin the offer and alleging, among other things, that the offer vilates federal securities laws, certain agreements between Ciba-Geigy and Spectra-Physics, and Ciba-Geigy's fiduciary duties. Spectra-Physics said the two Ciba-Geigy designess to its board were not present at yesterday's special meeting which voted to reject the offer as financially inadequate, unfair and not in the best interests of Spectra-Physics or its stockholders. The company said the board also authorized a special committee of outside directors to take whatever steps it deems necessary to protect the interests of Spectra-Physics and its stockholders and to investigate all alternatives to maximize the value of the stock, including talks with third parties. Spectra-Physics said a letter communicating the board's recommendation and reasons therefore is being mailed to stockholders. It said Robert Bruce, Reliance Group Holdings Inc's <REL> designee on Spectra-Physics' board, resigned his position on May 29. His letter of resignation said the action was to alleviate Ciba-Geigy's stated justification for making the unsolicited offer that it had not contemplated another significant investor having representation on the board when its Spectra-Physics' investment was made.

The boards of both companies have approved the merger, which will be accomplished through a tender offer by a Boeing subsidiary of 37 dlrs a share cash for all of ARGOSystems' shares, the companies said. Under the agreement, the Boeing subsidiary, TBC Holdings Corp, will begin the tender offer promptly. If at least 90 pct of the shares are not tendered, the offer will be prorated to 49 pct, the companies said. ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy 1,238,311 shares or 18.5 pct of the outstanding stock for 37 dlrs a share, they said. Also, Bill May, chairman of ARGOSystems, and three other officers have granted Boeing an option to buy their shares, another 8.9 pct of the outstanding stock, for 37 dlrs a share. ARGOSystems makes equipment to monitor and analyze military communications signals, electronic warfare equipment to monitor and jam radar signals and signal processing systems. For the nine months ended March 31, 1987, ARGOSystems reported earnings more than doubled to 6.3 mln dlrs or 95 cts a share from 3.1 mln dlrs or 46 cts. The year-ago period included a 2.2 mln dlr charge from a writedown of securities. Sales rose 23.5 pct to 70.9 mln dlrs. Sales are expected to exceed 100 mln dlrs for the fiscal year ending June 30, the companies said in a joint statement. The company's backlog is currently more than 180 mln dlrs, they said. It has about 1,200 employees. About 30 pct of ARGOSystems' business comes from international customers. \"ARGOSystems is a clear leader in its field. This association will expand our overall activities and significantly enhance our ability to compete in the defense electronics area,\" Boeing president Frank Shrontz said in a statement. ARGOSystems will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing Co. The merger following the tender offer will be subject to approval by ARGOSystems shareholders, the companies said. The tender offer and merger are subject to customary conditions and expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino notification waiting period, they said. "

            "BODY": "Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry sources said. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition, said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34 mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged. The agreement signed in January for the months from February to June is up for renegotiation. Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp <XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc <TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp <MOB> and Chevron Corp <CHV> 550,000 bpd between them. But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement. John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur . \"The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul,\" he said. Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price. Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco. Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp <CHV>, Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB> and Texaco Inc <TX> but is now owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.

It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable preferred stock for each common share. Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as a merger in which each holder would receive a combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred. The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would trade in the public market at its liquidation value. Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of preferred for the first five years, it added.. Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to a physical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did not provide details with respect to financing of his proposal, which is not subject to a financing condition. The company said dividends on the preferred being offered in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in years 12 and 13. It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of its ability to obtain the balance of the financing. Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding its equity participation in the new company. The second party anticipates executing a letter of intent when it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pak board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and option arrangement, the company said.

            "DATELINE": "    New York, June 1 - ",
            "BODY": "Publisher Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its recapitalization. The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp <FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with 4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan. The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have 8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent conveyance. The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to repay it. Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing. British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share, or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its alternatives. British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous increase effective on the June eight record date for the dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after the date. British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs worth of debentures. The suit also alleges that management, the board of directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price, the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase program and the manner in which its financing has been structured.

If OPEC adopts\nthe provisional ceilings of 16.6 mln bpd in third quarter and\n18.3 mln bpd in the fourth, there will probably be room for\noverproduction in the third quarter when demand for its crude\nwill probably be 17.5 to 18 mln, it said.\n    It said that the UAE and Ecuador may demand higher quotas\nin Vienna, but the biggest obstacle is Iraq, which has refused\nto honour its quota as it is less than that of Gulf War enemy\nIran.\n    But OPEC appears committed to a short meeting and realises\nsomething must be done about the Iraq issue, the report said.\n    According to Kleinwort's sources, Saudi Arabia has already\nheld separate talks with Iran and Iraq and is urging Iraq to be\nmore moderate.\n    \"One strong indication that some kind of deal may be\neventually worked out is the almost complete silence coming\nfrom Iran,\" it said.\n    Indications are that, in return for going along with the\nSaudi desire to maintain official prices in Vienna, Iran is\nseeking concessions from the kingdom on the Iraq issue, it\nsaid.\n    Kleinwort said the kingdom will face an increasingly uphill\ntask in trying to maintain prices around 18 dlrs beyond 1987.\n    Firstly, OPEC hardliners led by Iran are bound to oppose\nsuch a move. Secondly, other OPEC members will press for\nanother price rise if the dollar remains weak against other\ncurrencies.\n    Thirdly, Saudi Arabia may be forced to raise prices earlier\nthan it intended to ward off growing calls for higher prices\nfrom the U.S. To stimulate domestic drilling and exploration.\n    The report concluded that there is a strong possibility\nofficial OPEC prices will rise to 20 dlrs a barrel by end-1987\nand 22 dlrs a barrel by end-1988.\n REUTER\n\u0003\n\n",

The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD and the Bank of England. Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium term credit portfolio in the international capital markets. The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size and maturity of the credit and the currency. The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another cost reduction plan. At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets. On credits that are refinanced an original lender would receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions. "

The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s. Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved. It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies, the sources added. This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by Conoco. Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as the most likely candidate for the first field development project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway. "

            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 1 - ",
            "BODY": "Computer Associates International Inc's 800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate its strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition from International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Street analysts said. \"IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems software,\" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette. \"But the combination of the two companies will clearly present a much stronger front,\" he said. Besides IBM, \"Computer Associates will be far and away the most powerful company in the field,\" added E.F. Hutton analyst Terence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as system utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed, power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM. Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that will find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City, N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August, the company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independent software vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought 15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3 mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on sales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also, Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share. At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different businesses, only three of which were involved in computer software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his job as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services unit. Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a news conference that the merger would give computer users a single source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads in the applications software market, where analysts said it has been successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore, he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05 dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing and research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel. Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50 dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly 33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most software companies are currently valued at about 20 times per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the premium because of its earnings potential and customer base. Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25 pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently owns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target of maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department. Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang. "

Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the company this morning. The company said it is evaluating both proposals. Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment. Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and \"we may add a bank to that.\" \"We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,\" he said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock. Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group, which the company did not identify, topped his offer between now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an opportunity to respond. Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement regarding management's equity participation. Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management particpation was \"nominal.\" Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs. \"We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22 dlrs,\" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for 17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred stock. Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said \"you have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid.\" Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the company has not made the best strategic moves over the years. \"They have not done the right things at the right time,\" he said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings, he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln dlrs. Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people than many competitors, but it competes on price even though competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins. He noted that there have been no other publicly identified bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier Bilzerian proposal in mid-April. Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and Bilzerian's plan. "

            "BODY": "Flooding in the Red River on the Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a 24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed. \"The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,\" a company source said. The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region. Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood. \"But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.\" The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield Corp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline's operator. Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break. July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to 19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts. Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel. Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a barrel below WTI, respectively. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said. He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded. The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away. The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line. Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma, which is nearby. "

Traders said the story, which appeared in USA Today, added speculation which began on the street last week. They said there were rumors the stock was under accumulation and speculation abounded the company would soon receive an offer. A Hutton official declined comment. Hutton's stock rose 2-1/4 to 39-3/8. Hutton several months ago rejected a buyout offer from Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc <SHE>. The newspaper story mentioned speculation American Express Co <AXP>, the parent of Shearson, was a possible buyer. But traders said the rumors today did not name buyers. First Boston officials were not immediatley available for comment. Prudential Bache analyst Larry Eckenfelder said he doubted the speculation about American Express. He said he believed Hutton, which is occassionally surrounded by rumors, moved up today as a result of the newspaper article. \"Hutton is still a takeover candidate,\" said Eckenfelder. "

Mike Synar said today that while President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared at home to deal with a new energy crisis. Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S. participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing program of the International Energy Agency. The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal with any future oil cutoff. Synar said, \"the president is prepared to take military action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our nation for the next energy crisis.\" Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil, increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar, who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully advocated a test limited to training participants in oil sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

            "BODY": "share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), analysts said. \"The offer is inadequate,\" said Douglas Augenthaler, an analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on earnings estimates. USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at 48-1/8, down 3/8. USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board would meet to consider it. Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34 dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share. At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the low 40s, Augenthaler said. Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90 dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs. In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management business holds significant growth potential. The industry has grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at 15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said. Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable business and win cost-control benefits, he said. \"Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly signficant environmmental problems of its own,\" he said. Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer was \"grossly inadequate.\" "

One other small pipeline that Total also closed has a capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River in Fargo, Texas, Zollinger said. He said the closed pipelines run under river water and could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks and expose the piping. Zollinger said Total is waiting for the river waters to recede before they reactivate the pipelines. "

            "AUTHOR": "    By Michael Connor, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 1 - ",
            "BODY": "A quickly growing Texas-based distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs for Crazy Eddie Inc <crzy>, the leading New York City electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid. The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc <em> for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. \"I have mixed feelings,\" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. \"On the one hand it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?\" \"It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,\" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. \"Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in place.\" Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading. Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television. In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985. Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance. Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount. Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50. "

            "AUTHOR": "    BY LAWRENCE EDELMAN, REUTERS",
            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 1 - ",
            "BODY": "The investor group that has agreed to buy <Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal computer retailer public or sell it to other investors, industry analysts said. \"Now's a good time,\" said Joe Levy of International Data Corp. \"The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is on the way up again,\" he said. Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York. Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction. Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch 150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company. Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment. E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc <MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management. Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc <BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's <TAN> Radio Shack stores. \"The name of the game now is outbound sales forces, customer service and customer support,\" said Levy of International Data. Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985. Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell much of the franchisee dissent. "

            "DATELINE": "    Greensboro, N.C., June 1 - ",
            "BODY": "U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until the case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per share lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens offer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt. That information, Burlington said, was provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23 years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November, 1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to divulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to \"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its management,\" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or Burlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went public April 24 with their intention to take over the company. Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in February. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and dominion with a written statement that they did not provide inside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an effort to takeover Burlilgnton. \"The ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an American company,\" said burlington lawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market, the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid for Dominion. \"Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander,\" said Sidney Rosdeitcher, a Samjens lawyer.

            "BODY": "<Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL) said it will offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of Monier Ltd <MNRA.S>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a share bid by CSR Ltd <CSRA.S>. Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement. As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday. It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base. The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid. Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31. ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances. ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment. ETL and its <Feltex International Ltd> associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim, he added. Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid. He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids. As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder, Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing. CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option, resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture. CSR officials have also said they had no intention of raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention became public last week. "

            "DATELINE": "    PANAMA CITY, June 1 - ",
            "BODY": "Venezuela's central bank has ordered Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country, according to a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters. The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's volatile currency market. The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international operations. The telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela. In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar. But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de facto currency control. \"It is definitely a control in the sense that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,\" one broker here said. \"Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control,\" the broker said. The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls. He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs a day. \"It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,\" he said. The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks. \"We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's ridiculous,\" he said. \"They've been on a rampage against foreigners.\" The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct reserve requirement. In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures, the broker said. \"We used to have a forward market,\" he said. \"For a small currency it was miraculous.\" He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S. Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market.

            "BODY": "Dutch insurer Stad Rotterdam Anno 1720 N.V. <ASRN.AS> said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the shares of <Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V.>, a fully-owned unit of Swiss insurer <Union Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft>. Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies are found to be sufficiently compatible. Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum. The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986. Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer. Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said. He said the company was on course for independent recovery and was expected to reduce its losses further in 1987. "

The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group's latest offer of 4,410 francs per share, he told Reuters. The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp's <UK.> French subsidiary <Union Carbide France> and West Germany's Linde AG <LING.F>. Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs. This was accepted by Spain's <Carburos Metalicos SA> which sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon's stock and the right of first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority which agreed to sell Aga its 20 pct stake in Duffour et Igon. Under Aga's offer, shareholders can either accept a cash bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB. The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per share from Union Carbide France <UK>. Aga's offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the company, closes on June 24 and the results will be announced on July 21. Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410 francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during the takeover tussle. They traded at 856 francs on January 9 before the first suspension. "

            "TITLE": "POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK",
            "AUTHOR": "    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, June 2 - ",
            "BODY": "For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark. President of the powerful and independent West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raising eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate. \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy. \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy,\" she said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply.\" One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact. \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced. \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of many people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit. "

These vessels were out fishing,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen. The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing. It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year. The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and oil ministers. Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing vessels by Iran was not the first. Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said. \"However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were undertaking espionage activities,\" it said. Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the statement said. "

            "BODY": "Taiwan's central bank announced that as from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at the end of May. The central bank's statement added that the measure would be effective until the end of July. Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters. Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April, according to official statistics. Last week the central bank said that from today it would reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move was needed because of \"distortions\" in the foreign exchange market. Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar, have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank market to avoid exchange rate losses. Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9 billion in April. All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money. Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.. Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about 22 pct against the U.S. Dollar. Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will be dropped by the end of July or early August. Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs. Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to close at 1,803.08. "

Currency dealers have speculated that Japan and West Germany might come under pressure at next week's Venice summit to cut interest rates to boost their economies.

Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports. Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC manufactured goods in the year ended March 31. \"I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through expansion.\" \"While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not by reducing trade through import restrictions or export restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade,\" Tamura said.

The full names of the companies purchased from Gallaher are <Formatura Iniezione Polimeri Spa>, Genoa and <FIP U.K. Ltd>, Weybridge. Consideration for the purchases, which will be based on the net asset values per share of the companies, has yet to be finalised but some nine mln stg of the total represents debt assumed by Glynwed. FIP is a manufacturer of valves and other pressure pipe fittings in thermoplastics. Its products are complementary to those of Glynwed subsidiaries, Durapipe U.K. And Philmac. The acquisitions appreciably develop and strengthen Glynwed's strategic position in the thermoplastic pipework systems market. The sale by Gallaher reflects a decision to dispose of more peripheral businesses. Proceeds of the sale will be used in the continuing expansion of the Gallaher group. Glynwed shares were up 5p to 494 after the announcement. Gallaher is not quoted on the London Stock Exchange. "

It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap facilities, dealers said. Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension, dealers said. However, as one dealer noted: \"The market is still unsettled.\" Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business, traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight. Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early 9-1/2, 7-1/2. One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight then 8-1/2.

They reported offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close. The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at 0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The spot dinar was 0.27930/40. "

            "DATELINE": "    LONDON, June 2 - ",
            "BODY": "The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.�\u0005\u001eside measures to boost growth, he said. \"I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany,\" he added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates. Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\" He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and he was \"content\" with sterling's exchange rate. Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\" Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord. \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S. Budget deficit was \"very important.\" Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\" \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified,\" he said. Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in \"Japan bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years. Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism, he said. He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth. In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries. On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice. The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year. Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank. He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions. \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said. U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions. \"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\" Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions. He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have to push further.\" "

            "AUTHOR": "    By David Skinner, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    SYDNEY, June 2 - ",
            "BODY": "CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> intends to proceed with its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd <MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters. ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative. This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed bid. The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days. Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which holds just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller. He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture. The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR. CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option. ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond describing it as a long term investment. ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is a leader in building materials, Herbert said. \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said. CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago. Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert said: \"I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to wonder if Monier is the main target.\" Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals. Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April. The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval. Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares. ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price. Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands. \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of <Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL. Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid. "

            "BODY": "The scale of foreign exchange intervention the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Saying he was \"content\" with sterling's current value, Lawson told reporters he wanted \"to maintain the exchange rate stability we have all signed up for.\" He declined to say if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention. In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg. Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, \"We have been playing a very full part ourselves\" in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris. \"We wish to see it (stability) continuing,\" he added. Asked which techniques were available to preserve stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to tackle \"the market pressures there are from time to time.\" \"Interest rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times,\" he added. Lawson said he expected intervention to be \"sterilised\" by draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new issues of government securities and foreign currency sales, when the market allowed. This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention, he said. \"Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,\" Lawson said. \"I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale.\" "

Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration. Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.

            "BODY": "U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he will decide \"in the next few days\" whether to grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by Samjens Acquisition Corp. \"I do not know how I come down on this preliminary injunction,\" Gordon said after listening to arguments by attorneys for 1-1/2 days. \"It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much information as I have been. I have to consider what's been presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be winners,\" he said. Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally obtained confidential information about the company to make its offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada, were to succeed. Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group <MS> by one dlr per share. Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid 72 dlrs per share for Burlington. Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would \"kill the offer\" Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted. \"There's only one Burlington,\" he said. \"If we cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us.\" Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. \"We don't want that. We're not in this for the money,\" he said. Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o takeover of Burlington. \"Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider Jim Ammeen,\" Nathan said. An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge said he would not rule on the request today. "

It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350 mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of September. The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that partnership. An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit. The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale. Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60 pct of the Westin in Edmonton. Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert unrecognized asset appreciation into cash. As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership, the money will be used for general corporate needs, the spokesman said. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead underwriters for to the public offering. The limited partnership will be offered outside the U.S, Allegis said. "

Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government officials said. They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations. Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said. Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he said. This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high prices, he added. Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled. "

They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly. But there was no hint what the announcement might be. Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact. But they also noted that the White House has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10. The officials added that while the curbs complicated U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit. Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to U.S. goods. The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools. Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering to the pact. "

Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,\" Hodel told the Senate Energy Committee. Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration. Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay. \"The area could contain potentially recoverable oil resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production,\" Hodel said. He said production from the new section could begin about the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000 without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area. "

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base salary if they stay with the company through August 29. In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair. The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid, citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley and Co Inc, that it is \"inadequate and unfair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares,\" the company said. The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan Stanley to \"vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders' investment in the company,\" the company said. Among the alternatives the special committee will consider are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32 dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of dividends, Spectra-Physics said. The \"retention plan\" for the 52 top officers will pay an average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said. Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan \"in order to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the (Ciba-Geigy) offer.\" Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29, but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the company because their salaries have been sharply cut. Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in violation of securities law and with violating the intent of July 9, 1985 standstill agreement. Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20 pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat. Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance Group Holdings <REL>, which is controlled by New York investor Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct. Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power. "

            "BODY": "U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last week went further than the U.S. Had expected. But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips. Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand. \"There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought,\" said Shultz, speaking from Washington. \"It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here. \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy,\" he added. But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied: \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market. \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident.\" He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month's data. The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value. Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand. Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem. He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction.

            "BODY": "The operator of a major U.S. crude oil pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be several days before repairs are made and the system is functioning again. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco Inc <TX>, operator of the pipeline through its subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs will begin in about five days and expects it to take several more days to complete. \"At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get the job done,\" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to assess because of flooding on the Red River. The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said. The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said. Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with customers to determine their requirements. Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices. Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures complex rose 20 cts a barrel.

Lynch Chairman Mario Gabelli, who heads a group which owns 12.35 pct of Becor's 16.5 mln outstanding shares, said the Lynch bid \"is about one dlr better than the present offer.\" Gabelli previously said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission he felt the Becor managment buyout was unfar. The Lynch officer said he was invited by other Becor shareholders to make an offer. Following sale of Becor's aerospace subsidiary in February, the management group led by President William Winter announced plans for a 238.1 mln dlr leveraged buyout. was planning to take Becor for about 238.1 mln dlrs. A shareholder vote on the buyout offer is scheduled for June four. "

As previoiusly announced, the proposal calls for a transaction in which PNP shareholders would receive a combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative preferred stock for each common share.

Under the Bilzerian proposal, the dividend rate on the preferred stock would be set so that in the joint opinion of the financial advisor to Bilzerian and the financial advisor to Pay 'N Pak, the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation value on a fully distributed basis, the company said.

Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq. \"As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are under our protection with the exception, on a limited case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the region,\" Sims said. U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that the the arms would not be used elsewhere. He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war. Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack. Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11 Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional ships and air cover are under consideration. "

            "BODY": "Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the annual meeting, confirming a published report. Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag, Black said, \"That would not be wildly inaccurate,\" although he declined to disclose the actual cost. Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in Ontario and Quebec. Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000 readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10 such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23 dailies. \"There is really no end to the ones that are available,\" he told reporters, although he added that most remaining acquisition opportunities are in the U.S. He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC, of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth quarter. For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian dlrs last year. Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about 1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new Independent daily newspaper. Knight said The Independent was not affecting the Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The Guardian. Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post 1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share, including extraordinary gains from previous sales of discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs. Black told shareholders that first quarter operating earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs. Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter figures were not disclosed. He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss was sharply reduced from last year. "

A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for Romania had been \"exceptionally difficult\" and came after \"all options were seriously considered.\" But the statement said that despite concerns about human rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on human rights practices there. The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary and China. The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN for Hungary and China. "

The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. Since the administration made known its reflagging plans, congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted, and some charged the policy could lead the United States into the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq. The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf. The resolution was expected to pass without controversy today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution. Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the bill implied consent to Reagan's policies. "

            "BODY": "With more private investment, not more protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today. The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago. \"While textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,\" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation. CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms. Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries. President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year. However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation. Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said. He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct. Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct. \"The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered, and that exports can be expanded,\" Kelly said.

The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and Republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf. It did not, however, place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy. The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature. Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy. But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report. "

There was no indication the government would meet the conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN). According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986. The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage. In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults. Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion. If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the penalty. "

The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said he would try to prevent consideration of the bill. He said he will put a so-called \"hold\" on the bill until he finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting Kuwaiti tankers. Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war. Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to war. \"It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will blow sky-high at worst,\" said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth. "

            "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, June 2 - ",
            "BODY": "Currency futures are likely to move higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated as his replacement, currency analysts said. Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation, analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the June 8 Venice economic summit. In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency, analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower, analysts said. \"Disappointment of European central bankers over the appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower,\" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol Mackoff. \"The international community will not like this appointment,\" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S. budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner. Furthermore, \"that Greenspan was not named two months ago suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice -- and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,\" Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated only by concrete action as opposed to \"jawboning\" at the G-7 summit, he said. But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may be at an impasse, analysts said. Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the U.S. to do so, Mackoff said. The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the dollar could be forestalled, Horner said. However, \"the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing changes,\" Horner said. Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance. For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950. "

            "BODY": "Secretary of State George Shultz said the U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster than many predicted, and the consequences for its trade partners might be traumatic. \"The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustment necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in order to service our growing foreign debt,\" he told a conference attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their leading Western friends. \"In my view, this will happen more rapidly than many observers now predict.\" \"The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is becoming less effective,\" Shultz said. \"It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the world to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit, which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone.\" \"The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be possibly a traumatic experience,\" he added. \"While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew protectionist policies, you must act too,\" Shultz said. \"I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open their doors wider,\" he told the group, which included representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the European Community.

            "BODY": "<Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd> said in a statement it is making a tender offer for 22 pct of Kwik Save Discount Group Plc <KWIK.L> of Britain for a total 146.6 mln stg. Dairy Farm said it will offer to buy up to 32.58 mln Kwik Save shares at 4.50 stg each. The offer will bring Dairy Farm's stake in Kwik Save to 25 pct from the present 3.5 pct, or 5.25 mln shares. The offer, which will begin on Monday and ends June 30, requires that the shares tendered will bring its stake to at least 15 pct. Dairy Farm said it will finance the acquisition by placing 89 mln shares with affiliate Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd <JARS.HK> at 5.10 H.K. Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs. The placement will raise Jardine Strategic's stake in Dairy Farm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct. It said the Kwik Save purchase will also be financed with a loan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK>. It did not give the size of the loan but it said it would raise its net bank borrowings to a maximum of 2.2 billion H.K. Dlrs. Dairy Farm said it would reduce its bank borrowings by the proceeds from the previously announced sale of its office building in Sydney for 625 mln dlrs. It will consider raising additional capital, most probably through a placement of convertible preference shares in the Euromarket, it added. Company chairman Simon Keswick said the U.K. Market \"offers attractive opportunities for competitively priced food retailers\" and that \"a strategic investment in Kwik Save offers the best vehicle to pursue those opportunities.\" "

If that means waiting for a while, then so be it,\" Prebble said. He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon for the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it would post an excellent profit. Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability to prosper in future was hampered by its wholly-government-owned status. Prebble said access to new sources of capital would increase its ability to expand and develop. This sale announcement follows the public float in March of around 13 pct of the <Bank of New Zealand Ltd>. The government has said it will also float part of the capital of other state-owned operations, including <DFC New Zealand Ltd>, formerly Development Finance Corp of New Zealand Ltd, and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd.

They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April. Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said. Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being. Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top personal computers would continue at last year's level of 12,000 to 16,000 units a year. Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade. "

The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the central bank said in a telex. A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct discount rate. The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main monetary policy instrument for the last two years. The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said. The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on June 5, also by 0.10 points. "

He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia's production ceiling under its current OPEC quota, so they might be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week. Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude, Minas, had been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said. Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct. Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling. Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight supplies. A cargo of Duri loading in July was reportedly traded yesterday at 70 cents over its osp of 15.60 dlrs per barrel and Minas is trading about 20 cents higher, they said. "

            "BODY": "The French government's privatisation program, which began late last year, has earned the French State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry said. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion at the end of 1986. The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included banking group Societe Generale <SGEN.PA>, which began its two-week public flotation last Monday. The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as the private sale of telephone group <Cie Generale de Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers Saint-Gobain <SGEP.PA>, it added. The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991. Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the near future are television network TF-1 later this month and banking group Cie Financiere de Suez <FSPP.PA> in the autumn. The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a third of the government's programme would have been completed in less than nine months. Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched too low. He said that the average premium of shares trading on the Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar share flotations in Britain. "

Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint venture company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products for all types of drilling operations. He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from recession was under way in the oil and gas industries. \"Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment\" Paues said. DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe, North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa. Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back exploration activities. Officials said the complementary character of the two firms' operations was a further reason. "

            "AUTHOR": "    By Judith Matloff, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    LONDON, June 18 - ",
            "BODY": "Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say. They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity. \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\" Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a \"package.\" Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices. Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna. \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.

She said market forces have a major influence on exchange rates and said she did not know the right value for the dollar against the Yen or the Mark. Seger told the Savings and Loan executives that she was concerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange rate influences. \"I am concerned that we have gotten so nervous,\" about exchange rates, Seger said. She said the Fed takes into account additional factors in determining monetary policy than the value of the dollar against other currencies. On the economy, Seger called the latest figures in gross national product a modest upward revision. "

            "BODY": "Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts estimated. Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said. Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of the unit, leading investors to take profits. After the announcement, the company's stock retreated, closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4. \"It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat disappointing,\" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He said rumors of the spin-off had been around \"for a couple of days.\" Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its value was not reflected in the company's stock price. Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year. Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500 to 600 mln dlrs. Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the company would use the proceeds to pay down debt. But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been presented to its board. The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion dlrs. "

The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax Commissioners that any such provision was a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible. The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of abandoning a rig. An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible from corporation tax payable. It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he said. Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was shared by the industry as a whole. The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were built into the accounts, one analyst added.

            "BODY": "The European Community (EC) accused the United States of violating a political commitment to free trade through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a customs user fee. EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters. Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to improve its balance of payments. The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system. The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue. Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers, pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September. When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT jargon as \"standstill and rollback.\" Tran criticised Washington for the \"superfund\" tax on oil imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security. Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules. The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round, to decide any further action on the charges. The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices. The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its legislation. Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community, brought the dispute to the GATT last year. "

Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S. Legislators were failing to realise \"the true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment. A British parliamentary report said that up to March British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure. The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and \"selectiveness\" towards foreign contractors had denied British competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them from technological research for SDI. Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts under conditions of fair and open competition. \"All we ask is for our companies to be given similar opportunities,\" he added. If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures, Younger said. "

            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 18 - ",
            "BODY": "Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group Inc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette Co that could draw some big international players and in the process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts said. Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands to make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling takeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of three yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis of Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262 mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment. \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if someone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45 dlrs per share.\" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's operations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon has recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if some company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble Co <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>, RJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and Ralston Purina Co <RAL>. \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a Wall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the company is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette to resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board consenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he said. Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on. \"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of calculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by shareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT, three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time. According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial adviser. "

            "BODY": "U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact, according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups. The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries. But Cato chairman William Niskanen added \"the two nations' generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement.\" The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries. The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained. Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and this could hit some Canadian trade practices. He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts. Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S. exports to Canada. A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said. It would also increase the gross national products of both countries. Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 18 - ",
            "BODY": "Robert Fildes, president and chief executive of Cetus Corp <CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp is not interested in buying Cetus. Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. \"This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus,\" Fildes told Reuters in an interview. \"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement,\" said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes. Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co <EK> and W.R. Grace <WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields. As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development. Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe. \"We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe,\" said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market. Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business. Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms. But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies.\" Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to \"keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.\" Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years. \"Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen, while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership,\" said Fildes.

Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S. Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed. He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress, \"but simply because of the adjustments the U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt.\" Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.

Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30 dlrs a share for 76.5 mln dlrs, lifting its stake to 49.4 pct. A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched, also at 30 dlrs a share for a maximum further cost of 184.4 mln. The Shaw's Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept the offer, thus assuring Sainsbury's a total holding of 74.0 pct. The company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to <Warburg Securities Ltd> which it said would be sufficient to finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable. Shaw's operates a chain of 49 supermarkets in Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire which in 1986 produced sales of 1.1 billiob dlrs and pretax profit of 31.1 mln. At the end of 1986 it had net assets of 88 mln dlrs. Last September, Sainsbury's increased its stake in Shaw's to 28.5 pct. In the year to March 21, it reported a rise in pretax profit to 246.9 mln stg from 192.7 mln on sales that increased to 4.04 billion from 3.58 billion. Sainsbury shares had fallen five pence before the announcement to 590p from last night's close but were unmoved by news of the deal. "

They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is now awaiting its approval. CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31 this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1 at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each. CPC officials also said the company agreed with the Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the government selling price. Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through C.Itoh. Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments. Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each. CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable. CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year. "

She gave no dates or prices for the transaction but said the units would be sold by negotiation. She declined to give any turnover or profit figures for the packaging and labelling operations, beyond saying that they were very profitable. They formed a self-contained part of the overall group, she said. Analysts said the packaging and labelling division could be sold for up to 150 mln stg. Earlier this week group chairman Robert Maxwell also said it expected to float its Mirror group newspaper subsidiary, bought from Reed International Plc <REED.L> for 100 mln stg in 1984. The spokeswoman said that BPCC intended to keep a majority share in the newspaper group if it was floated. BPCC is currently locked in legal battles resulting from its attempt to take over U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ>. Earlier this week, BPCC launched a two-for-three rights issue to raise 640 mln stg and said the money raised would enable it to renew its assault on Harcourt. It has also expressed interest in Dutch publisher Kluwer NV <KLUW.AS>. "

The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable. \"I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far,\" Lukman said. He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December. \"Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our collective will to keep the market strong,\" he said. He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this was significant for its members. Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a restocking now for the winter was responsible for current market strength. "

Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would argue that interest rates are still too high and deter investment in industry. \"But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were intervening to support sterling and had some temporary difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at the time,\" he added.

            "AUTHOR": "    By Norma Cohen, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    LONDON, June 19 - ",
            "BODY": "More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates. And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money. The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business. While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a few years ago. But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders, mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts. As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds. \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\" said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society, explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only offering variable rate mortgages. The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more. Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business, officials at all three institutions said. The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans. \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans. But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product.\" Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year. The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman. \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume. In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets. But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money. Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director. Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument. But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably. However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor. For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years. "

Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial adviser, declined comment. A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.\"It's completely inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they drop the recapitalization,\" he said. Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned. Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011 in light of the recapitalization. Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon Brothers Inc <SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face amount, Harcourt said. Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr, they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares. Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not required to issue common to debenture holders who did not convert prior to June eight. An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New York said \"there's no basis to think that it's us.\" "

A spokesman for the governor said nothing will be decided today, but said the governor will evaluate later whether to call a special session in the next few days. The governor's office said the possible action was triggered by a proposal by Dayton-Hudson Corp <DH>, which has been the subject of takeover rumors. A spokesman for the governor said the company proposed several amendments to Perpich designed to make any takeover attempt in the state more difficult. Dayton-Hudson suggested amendments be passed and instituted by next Friday, the spokesperson said. Press reports in Minneapolis newspapers this morning quoted several legislators as saying they were inclined to support legislation that would help Dayton-Hudson, according to a governor's spokesperson. Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe was quoted as saying he would be inclined to support any action that would help the company, the spokesperson said. Robert Vanasek, the House speaker designate, was quoted in the Minneapolis Star and Tribune as saying, \"We are taking their (Dayton-Hudson) concerns very seriously and we are going to do what we can to help.\" "

In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000. The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker states concerned about the effects on customs revenue. The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items. "

            "AUTHOR": "    By SUSAN SHERER, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 19 - ",
            "BODY": "U.S. crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session. They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December, have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices should begin easing. \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output. \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy. \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are committed to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua, analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000 barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines, producers receive less money for their oil. \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\" said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he said. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war. \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag, with naval escorts. \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.

Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said. Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs, compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs. The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said. Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project uneconomical even with government price supports and loan guarantees, Unocal said. The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to 5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said. "

Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade, said he was aware of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added \"the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills.\" He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit, and \"it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.\" Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs. Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large, annual trade surpluses with the United States. Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States, but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2 billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs. The European Community has also opposed the bills. Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices. He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor, expected next week. Rodriguez said \"the region needs trade to continue development. We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation.\" Rodriguez said: \"we need to keep the market opens - especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress.\" President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed \"protectionist,\" and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation. Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez said as yet \"the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.\" "

Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ> might bid for Reed, a paper and printing company, pushed Reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread decline in U.K. Equity prices. Share market analysts said speculators were buying the stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp <BPCL.L>. Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to take it over, analysts added. They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC's bid for Harcourt was unsuccessful, it could turn its attention to Reed. "

The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected soon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock. According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover. According to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain independent. Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor Rudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help. A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor is expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's anti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend itself. Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators would probably look at language similar to that contained in Indiana and New York law.

            "AUTHOR": "    By Irwin Arieff, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, June 19 - ",
            "BODY": "President Reagan's nominee as top policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets. David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to become the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's first term and was Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago. Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they should pay about the same rates of duties. Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face.\" He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule. Yeutter said government and business moves are based on data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making. He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under the new system, with about half expected to join the system by January 1988. "

            "AUTHOR": "    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters",
            "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, June 19 - ",
            "BODY": "The six basis point rise of the past month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the dollar holds firm. \"Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis points over the last month, largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,\" Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities, said. Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the longer term. Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy. The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down 1.5 pct, respectively. Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was \"surprising, much larger than expected,\" according to Kahan. \"Unless quickly reversed,\" such a trend \"will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,\" Kahan said. Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have \"slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board annual targets,\" the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road, he said. Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently, analysts said. September T-bonds \"are up almost six points since about May 18,\" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June, Duggan said. While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far, and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level. \"The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market,\" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said. The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S. currency has made little headway of late, analysts said. \"The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar,\" Kahan said. Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact and size of the U.S. budget deficit, \"although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week,\" Kahan said. In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement. However, a successful auction could prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market psychology. "

The Superintendency of Banks and the Technical and Judicial Police have both begun probes of Cambio la Guiara, Azpurua said on Friday night. Police said the owners of the firm, Mario Muggia and his brother Luigi Muggia, have left Venezuela. Cambio la Guiara operated in part on the \"parallel market\" in which traders buy and sell dollars among themselves. The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel market, blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the value of the U.S. Dollar here. Juan Domingo Cordero, vice-president of the Caracas Stock Exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house, said on Friday he had begun legal action against Cambio la Guiara for issuing him four checks without funds for a total amount of almost one mln dlrs. The Cambio la Guiara exchange house had operated in Venezuela for more than 20 years. "

            "BODY": "OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said. \"Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January,\" a Japanese refiner said. The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter. Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for U.K. Brent, traders said. They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs. \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader. Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term, having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday. \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,\" said one international oil trader in Tokyo. \"But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought back up again pretty quickly,\" he added. One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9. Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices. Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September. Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd, against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said. Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast. Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels. \"Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much,\" an oil industry analyst said.

They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor. Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher, left in a major oil industry shake up last December. The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently. The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil market. The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut. Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December. Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business, the sources said. The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi, Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic Port. "

OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter. Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices. Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995. The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd. Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks. Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep prices stable. Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December. Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986. But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit. Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production. "

The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the interbank market today, the officials said. The central bank was concerned about growing market expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices, the officials said. But money traders said the market generally shrugged off the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid was 3.75 pct, they said. The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said. The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy. \"We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip any further,\" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing market expectation of higher rates will remain. \"If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay above four pct for the time being,\" he said.

            "BODY": "Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the government relaxed restrictions on some imports including luxury cars. The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1 billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs, compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and 1.113 billion dlrs of imports. Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery and raw materials, to increase industrial production. The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told reporters. Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the government were not included in the policy, they added. They said the country's total import bill (both commercial and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87. The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the economy. Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for its main export jute, \"which will certainly affect our export earnings\" in the coming year. Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln in 1986/87, according official figures. But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target. "

The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S. U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports. The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled. But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10. "

The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group of five heads of delegation established by the 77th (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to undertake the necessary contacts with those countries. \"The conference observed the continued fall in the value of the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied and reported to the next meeting of the conference.\" \"The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next ordinary meeting. \"The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year from October 7, 1987. \"The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be convened in Vienna on December 9, 1987.\" "

Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: \"We would be badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts. \"This could, under certain circumstances, release new inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to higher interest rates,\" he added. Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter. \"But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy finds itself on a course of growth,\" he said. \"I expect this development to continue in the coming months.\" Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous. \"For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts,\" he added. \"This includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far as possible.

            "BODY": "OPEC output for the second half of 1987, including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday, Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said. Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter target. Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, \"OPEC third quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd\" Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices. Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd, rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September. Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369 mln in the second half. Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. \"We will not discuss it. There will not be any change,\" he said. Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed. \"We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,\" he said. Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting. Ali said \"The problem of differentials is a real one. I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes.\" Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said \"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do the work of another minister.\" Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades. OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes. "

DataCard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common stock. The dividend is designed to deter National Computer or other potential suitors from preventing DataCard from evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value, DataCard said. National Computer told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid for DataCard. On June 25 DataCard filed suit in Hennepin County District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct stake of its stock to National Computer. In announcing the rights plan, DataCard said it \"is not designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of DataCard's stockholders.\" The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 44 pct or more of DataCard's common stock. Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy 1/500th of a share of DataCard Series A junior participation preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the rights. The rights dividend distribution is payable July 9 to shareholders of record July 9. "

            "BODY": "Enetertainment Marketing Inc and its president Elias Zinn have demanded a list of Crazy Eddie Inc shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June 26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie shareholders \"regarding the affairs\" of the company. Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer. Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it would be provided with \"certain information\" about Crazy Eddie, it told the SEC. Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales, proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the possible participation of Crazy Eddie management. Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future. Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and investment banker. In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility with the company, plus further declines in the price of its stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are \"continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to their investment\" in Crazy Eddie stock. Depending on its evaluation of the company, including actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open market, through private purchases or in connection with a merger or tender offer. According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93 dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Comission, the group of firms said it holds 2,430,100 shares of Digiorgio common stock. Of the total, 2,059,400 shares are held by GAMCO Investors Inc and Gabelli Funds Inc. for investment purposes, the group said. Gabelli-Rosenthal and Partners LP and G and R Partners, which hold the remaining 370,700 Digiorgio common shares, told the SEC their \"purpose is to ultimately obtain control of Digiorgio contingent upon approval of Digiorgio,\" according to the SEC filing. As previously reported, Gabelli and Co Inc, acting as investment advisor to a group including Gabelli-Rosenthal, proposed on June 25 to acquire all Digiorgio common shares for a per share price of 20 dlrs in cash, a subordinated note with a face value of eight dlrs, 14 pct redeemable preferred stock, and one common share of the post-buyout company. The June 25 buyout proposal, which remains open until July 17, also provides that key members of Digiorgio management and some of its directors would be invited to remain with the firm and participate in the group acquiring the company. The proposal is also subject to a due diligence review, execution of a merger agreement, arrangement of financing and receipt of government approvals, all of which Gabelli and Co said could be completed within 60 days. Between April 13 and June 26, the entire group led by Gabelli Group Inc made net purchases of 403,600 Digiorgio common shares at 22.20 dlrs to 26.79 dlrs a share. "

The group added its has already had \"some contacts\" with others concerning the company, but said no understandings have been reached. \"The (Cardis) common shares continue to offer opportunity for price appreciation on the basis of the company's asset value and earnings momentum,\" the Brookehill group told the SEC. The group, which currently holds 318,900 Cardis common shares, consists of New York-based Brookehill Partners and its two subsidiaries, Brookehill Equities Inc, a brokerage, and Moore, Grossman and deRose Inc, an investment advisor. Walter Grossmman, S. Edward Moore and Robert deRose, all of New York, each own one-third interests in Brookehill Partners. Since April 27, members of the Brookehill group made net purchases of 6,000 Cardis common shares at approximately 4 dlrs a share. The group told the SEC it may continue to purchase additional Cardis stock, but also reserved the right to sell its shares in the company. "

            "BODY": "The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a takeover attempt by Campeau Corp. In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's takeover offer. Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo. On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said. Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at thwarting Campeau, the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an amended SEC filing, the agency charged. Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct 3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint said. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or 48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes after it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal tender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern, the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future. Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. "

The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury said in a two-sentence announcement. The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands over the past eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman said. The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the spokesman said. Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the spokesman said. He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance at lower interest rates. However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced with lower yields. "

            "BODY": "Corporate mergers and acquisitions in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a leading business-backed organization said. The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding communities had not. Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but another 21 firms were added to the list. Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco. During the period, only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status. Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California. However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were created during the period. At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California. Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area. \"It's a great place to run a business,\" he added, \"but it's a hell of a place to do business with government.\" The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle & Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis, McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that, partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth in San Francisco has slowed since 1980. In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and charitable activities. "

            "BODY": "A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron Corp's <CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln barrels, industry analysts said. Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K. Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API crude oil from the tertiary \"Alba\" sand through a three-inch surface choke. \"The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320 mln barrels,\" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson and Co told Reuters. He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25 pct. Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be plugged and a sidetrack drilled. \"The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs up,\" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said. Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well showed that it flows well. \"Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low, it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be recovered,\" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters. However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not disclose any reserve figures. Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial and developed, there would be a ready local market for the heavy crude it produced. \"Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a lot narrower today,\" Osborne said. Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons (UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd and Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd. "

Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to 320,000 bpd next January, the minister said. \"We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to produce during the past few months,\" he said. Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean production from March to May this year. Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved. \"They understood our position and we believe we remain within the spirit of the (quota) agreement,\" he said. Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported. While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four mln barrels of products, Santos said. "

He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran. Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday, \"At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of an armed encounter with us. \"We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S. Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.\" The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf. The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks. Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, \"We won't have any comment or response to the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not helpful or welcome.\" Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

Under the agreement the companies said Continental will acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired on or before November 30, 1984. The sale is expected to be completed on or before November one and is subject to meeting certain conditions. Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9 billion dlrs generated by its tire operations. Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs. GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire employees under the agreement. Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt. In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive components businesses. Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company, including general tire. \"The price paid for General tire would not cause us to reevaluate that estimate,\" said Tilden. General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada. In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said the sale of General Tire \"represents a critical accomplishment in our plan to restructure GenCorp.\" Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of its other businesses are \"proceeding satisfactorily.\" Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal Communications Commission. GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV. "

At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H. Robins. After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger. But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon Shield related liabilities. After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln dlrs. Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated 1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000 claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the Dalkon Shield interuterine device.

Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows its serious intent to penetrate the California market. The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located. Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California. \"This marks our first major expansion in California, particularly in the south,\" said Citicorp Savings President Edward Valencia, in a statement. Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than Sears was in that market. \"We do believe they will be a better competitor than Sears,\" said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home Federal Savings and Loan Association <HFD>, based in San Diego. Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to convert the branches to banks at that time. In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp <GWF>, H F Ahmanson and Co <AHM>, Golden West Financial <GWD> and Great American First Savings Bank <GTA>.

            "BODY": "Prospects appear slim for a summer meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains agreement, Agriculture Department officials said. The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February. However, any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through September, 1988, USDA officials said. \"It will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during July,\" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the next talks could still be a \"couple more months,\" he said. There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made. \"I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer or before the next agreement year begins,\" a USDA source said. Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's crops, he said, \"There are too many variables now. It would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.\" Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping logistics and production outlooks. "

            "BODY": "The Justice Department said it asked the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal. Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger plan. Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow. \"Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its operations,\" Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers of interstate bus companies. But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways immediately. \"The department has just begun to receive relevant information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the process of assessing the correctness of the company's allegations,\" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule said in comments submitted to the ICC. Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems. Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of Trailways' terminals, buses and garages. The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that Trailways \"could collapse in a matter of days.\" They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs, with another six mln dlrs due June 30. The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into bankruptcy \"at any time.\" Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference. Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued. Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were \"overproducing in an exaggerated manner\" above their assigned quotas, he said.

            "BODY": "If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street, Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a serious way, Japan investment managers say. The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar securities, have already sold U.S. Equities. But \"if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw significant funds from U.S. Shares,\" said Akira Kawakami, deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's international investment department. An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in U.S. Bonds. \"Japan-U.S. Interest rate differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability,\" said Kawakami. U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S. Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise. But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning. \"Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,\" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment department said. Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914. \"Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult, considering the dangers,\" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed income securities marketing group. Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for. The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said. \"The basic background which has supported the stocks and bonds markets has not changed,\" said Norio Okutsu, assistant general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. \"But new outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing.\" However, this was already evident three months ago, he said.

            "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, Oct 20 - ",
            "BODY": "Rises in West German and international interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said. \"We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,\" Poehl told an investment conference. \"I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates,\" he said. Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct. Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in late September. The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to 3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct. These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt. Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability. Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended. But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday. Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and currency developments. Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said \"You have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.\" The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he said. Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany, saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy. The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said. \"Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest rates have risen substantially more,\" Poehl said. This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market, he said. Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits. \"The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is definitely underway,\" he said, noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures. The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention, he said. "

Lawson said the U.K. Economy is fundamentally sound and added that stock markets had reflected that recently. \"I profoundly believe in the market system as the best way for securing economic prosperity (but) that does not mean to say the markets are infallible.\" \"My advice to small investors...Is to remain calm.

            "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, Oct 20 - ",
            "BODY": "Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues, government and private economists said. A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy, they said. Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said. But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said. Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase. A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S. And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. \"They need to support the stock and security markets,\" he said. But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week. Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago. With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said. \"There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't be that big,\" said another. Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said. Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending, one government economist said. In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation, one central bank official said. \"That will at least take a couple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.

            "DATELINE": "    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - ",
            "BODY": "Indonesia told the oil industry on Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return. President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas. \"In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws,\" Suharto said. \"Apart from that, the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry,\" he said. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration. \"As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully aware of this situation,\" Subroto said. \"The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a selective basis.\" Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil industry sources say. Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions. But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered. President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated. Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986. Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies. Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas, such as when a field is designated commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made. He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive. Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years. \"This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.\" Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said. Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted. Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective, based on how much capital would be invested. "

The reduction is effective immediately. No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical and Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at 9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market rates would take. Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices, money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal Reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the economy and the financial system. Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16 percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a point (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday), and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's average of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discount rate cut to calm the markets, dealers said. "

Yesterday, Crazy Eddie agreed not to oppose a slate of candidates to its board proposed by the Committee to Restore Stockholder Value, a shareholder group led by the <Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund L.P.> and Entertainment Marketing Inc <EM>, that has been seeking to oust current management. Crazy Eddie said the new amendments limit future amendments to the plan, modify the definition of \"continuing directors\" and permit amendment or termination of the plan with the consent of the company's shareholders if there are no continuing directors in office or the approval of at least three such directors cannot be obtained. The company also said it approved a certificate of designation with respect to its 4.5 mln shares of authorized, but previously undesignated and unissued shares of preferred stock and adopted an employee stock ownership plan. Crazy Eddie also that it requested that the shareholder group make a commitment not to take the company private until Crazy Eddie has had a chance to recover from current financial difficulties, a committment that the group rejected. Crazy Eddie said it will hold its annual shareholders meeting on November 6. "

            "BODY": "U.S. And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets, London economists said. \"There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip,\" said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett. \"If not, there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\" But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits. \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates,\" he added. Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind. \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel's Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in danger. \"The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets,\" Dennis noted. David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said Morrison. \"The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,\" he said. "

            "BODY": "An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state, economists said. An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending. \"In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure,\" noted Peter Spencer, U.K. Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data, which compared won stg August rise, U.K. Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities. Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data, before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout. U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response, resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out. Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, \"With the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last thing the Bank of England would want to do,\" Spencer said. \"The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,\" said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury. But \"The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign,\" noted Paul Temperton, U.K. Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct. It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending. Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets. Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour, he said. In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity markets in the past few days, \"There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales,\" Temperton said. \"Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,\" he added. \"I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality,\" Spencer said. A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending, adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending. Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing. Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. "

            "BODY": "Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2 pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here. Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project. Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets. Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year. Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth. The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August, field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said. Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence. BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown. Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company said. September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said. Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said. Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd in September, compared with 100,188 in August. Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in August. Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well, cutting September production to just two days. "

Jacobs told Reuters he sold the Gillette stake, which he called \"substantial\" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a period of several days. He said he sold the stock at a profit, but did not disclose the selling price. Gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade, off the high of 45-7/8 reached after Revlon announced its bid. Jacobs said he sold his Gillette stake based on an \"investment decision. I surely did not see this happening,\" he said of Monday's stock market free-fall. A Gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment. Jacobs said he and fellow investor Carl Pohlad continue to hold a stake in Allegheny International Inc <AG>. In August they disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of Allegheny and would consideer seeking control of the company. "

We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit and the trade deficit,\" Regan said. \"I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular moment,\" Regan said when asked about the prospects for a recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street. \"I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the same conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money supply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now.\" Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions on program trading. \"I think that that's exacerbated, exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they must stop,\" he said.

In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program (EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it. \"Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit,\" he said. \"There's no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow, the longer it is to wean it.\" In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing list of commodities to an increasing number of countries. Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies \"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy\" and said he saw an end to the expansion of the EEP. \"I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those, particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to some agreement to put an end to it,\" he said.

Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament. He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983. Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil, slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln. January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million. Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry. The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988 budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday. "

The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf. The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later. The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue, including an expression of support or of disapproval for Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday. "

            "BODY": "U.S. military planners ruled out Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said. U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a \"measured and appropriate response\" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters. Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf. \"It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action,\" Norman Polmar, a defense analyst and author, said. He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack. In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack. Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire. \"We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any chance at all,\" he said, adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping. In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf. \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities,\" Cordesman said. He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, \"but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures.\" "

Alan Powers, chief of the Minerals Maanagement Service for the department, said the delay is to have more time to study the effects of drilling noise on whale migrations. Powers said the state has asked for additional noise data for the sale area off Alaska's North Slope. A new date has not been set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March, Powers said. Some 3,930 blocks encompassing about 21 mln acres are involved in the proposed sale. The area is between three and 160 miles off the northern coast of Alaska in the Artic Ocean between the Canadian border and 162 degrees west longitude. "

However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman. It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed before they become exercisable at five cents per right. The company said the rights will expire on the later of February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics such as market accumulations which would interfere with its ability to maximize stockholder value. The rights become exercisable if any person or group acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding shares at 65 dlrs per share. It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its board. A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an official response to Edelman's bid by Friday, Oct 23. "

It would be nice if the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,\" said the official who asked not to be named. He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has stationed forces to protect shipping lanes. The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag. Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied, \"I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower.\" The senior U.S. official said his remark was an endorsement of the U.S. attack.

            "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - ",
            "BODY": "The Bank of New York Corp <BK> said it reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a Bank of New York spokesman said. \"The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,\" a Bank of New York spokesman said. Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares. Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6 pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one Irving share. At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would affect the acquisition. \"If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,\" said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. \"And the market is saying the deal won't go through,\" Alpert said. \"The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share, then they won't go at a lower price,\" another analyst said. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford to retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal. \"With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will look good to Irving shareholders,\" said Michael Flores, a consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry. \"Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed,\" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. \"In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered more than the acquirees,\" another analyst said.

September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August. Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a similar 1986 period. Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222 mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said. The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach 10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and 15.4 billion dlrs of imports. He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period. "

At current market levels, it would suffer a 70 mln dlr aftertax loss on its holding, a spokesman said. Dart said it will not solicit authorization to call a meeting of Dayton Hudson shareholders. Dart had offered to buy Dayton Hudson for 68 dlrs per share, valuing the Minneapolis based retailer at 6.6 billion dlrs. That offer was rejected by the company. Following the selloff in takeover stocks last week, and the market's decline this week, Dayton Hudson stock closed at 27-1/2 today, off 2-1/2. Dart's holdings amounted to just under five pct of Dayton Hudson. A Dart spokesman said the 1.4 mln shares were sold in the market today. "

            "BODY": "The United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month, Reagan Administration officials said. President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods. The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers. Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs. Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers. The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods. U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week. The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement. "

Southland did not elaborate on the SEC order of investigation, and company officials could not be reached for comment late Tuesday. The SEC has a long-standing policy against confirming or denying the existence of investigations. The proxy statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is required for a November 5 shareholders meeting called to approve the previously announced acquisition of Southland by a company controlled by Southland chairman John Thompson and members of his family. Earlier this year, a group led by Thompson acquired majority ownership of Southland through a 77 dlrs a share tender offer for 31.5 mln shares of Southland common stock. If the merger is approved, common stock still outstanding will be converted into the right to receive 61.32 dlrs a share in cash plus a fraction of a share of preferred stock. "

Several other takeover proposals have crumbled following declines in financial markets, leading to speculation that Edelman might also drop his offer. Telex fell 11 to 34-1/4. Earlier today, Carl Icahn dropped his bid to take Trans World Airlines Inc <TWA> private and Dart Group Corp <DARTA.O> said it abandoned plans to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp <DH>. Both cited market conditions. \"Nothing fundamental has changed with the company. The stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so there's no reason for us to change,\" said Daniel Good, head of Shearson Lehman merchant banking. \"Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be in place,\" Good said. Shearson has agreed to provide bridge financing of up to 600 mln dlrs for the Edelman group. "

Carney was outlining the government's new position on the farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). While few details were released, Carney said the government would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial barriers. \"Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade,\" a government background paper said. \"Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs, credit could be given to countries which effectively control the output of farm products,\" the papers said.

            "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - ",
            "BODY": "Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system. He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them. The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking. Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament. The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services. Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts \"other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had better get serious about improving the GATT.\" The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries. Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT. Yeutter said, \"increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.\" He said, \"a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living.\" Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism. He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade. The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising. Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade. Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto. He said, \"President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.\" "

Anderson said. \"It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,\" Anderson told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. \"I believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.\" Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about 4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear. \"If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle East,\" he said. \"We're soon going to be right back where we were in 1973 and 1979.\" Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb. \"There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't enough supply,\" he said. \"There have been no major oil discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.\" Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

After the meeting, a Bonn finance ministry spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels. The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing key interest rates, saying they were not in line with last February's Louvre accord. "

Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow events with caution.

The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing short-term money market interest rates. He had said the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February. The meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesman said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to currency stability and monetary policy. Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into the West German money market in a move which money market dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary authority to curb interest rate rises. The spokesman described Monday's talks, which he called private, as very positive. "

The Treasury described the meeting as \"a very positive, private meeting in Frankfurt, West Germany which had been agreed upon last week. \"The parties agreed to continue economic cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible application including cooperation on exchange rate stability and monetary policies,\" the Treasury said. The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg \"are consulting with their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.\" The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven leading industrial countries including the United States and West Germany to promote currency stability. Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this week and the department earlier refused to release details of his travel itinerary, citing security considerations. "

            "BODY": "The European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year, an EC commission spokesman said. He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq. EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S. Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones, the spokesman said. Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S. Manufacturers. It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year. Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the countries involved in the Airbus project.

Under the plan, the board declared a dividend of one share purchase right for each of the Northeast common shares held of record as of November two, the company said. Initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically trade with Northeast's shares, the company said. However, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or more of Northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of Northeast's shares, the rights will become exerciseable and separate rights certificates will be distributed, the company said. The rights will entitle holders of Northeast's common shares to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of 60 dlrs a share, the company said. The company said that in the event of certain triggering events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights, other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event Northeast enters into certain business combination transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the rights, the company said. Northeast said it will be entitled to redeem the rights at one cent per right until the occurence of certain events. "

            "BODY": "Recent announcements from Moscow of next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said. USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes. Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be \"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.\" \"This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,\" the analyst said. In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month. USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said. Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said. While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest. A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes. "

            "AUTHOR": "    By Ian Jones",
            "DATELINE": "    LONDON, Oct 19 - ",
            "BODY": "Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said. December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday. \"Fundamentals are awful,\" said Philip Lambert, analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln bpd, little changed from September levels. Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 18.5 mln bpd. The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said. Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"a responsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict. Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation. The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said. The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger. Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said.

In Washington, President Reagan said the United Nations was being informed of the attack under the provision of the U.N. Charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right of self-defense. The U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said Perez de Cuellar had no comment on the attack, taken in response to Iranian action against an American-owned tanker last week, but was trying to find out \"what actually happened.\" Calls to Iran's U.N. commission elicited no response.

The funds were raised through BCI's first such fund - the Baring Euaring European Capital Trust - from investors in nine European countries. It expects to raise another 40 mln ECUs soon through a French fund and a fund for U.S. Investors. BCI was set up last year by Baring Brothers to advise buy-out and development capital investors. BCI said the new fund is structured as a Guernsey-based unit trust, which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. It will be advised by BCI and managed by a company owned jointly by Barings and the management of BCI. Individual investments are expected to range between one and 10 mln ECUs and are likely to be concentrated in the U.K., Germany and France. BCI said its aims are to invest in established companies, principally family companies with succession-issues and corporate spin-offs. "

            "BODY": "International monetary officials will rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets, economists and currency traders said. \"I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets. It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,\" said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp. In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed. His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a tailspin. The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about 1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one stage and U.S. Treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points. "

The board also said it will ask representatives of the Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting themselves with the business and affairs of the company as promptly as possible. To that end, the committee's representatives will be invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers, bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said. The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri group would only increase the expenses of the company, create further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company personnel. A further release from the company will follow, it said. "

The company said the agreement calls for the holders of common stock in Hal Roach to exchange their shares on a one-for-one basis for shares in the combined company. It said holders of Robert Halmi common will exchange their shares on a two-and-one-half-for-one basis for shares in the combined company. The company said the swap will be tax-free. The company also said <Qintex Ltd>, a 35 pct owner of Hal Roach common stock, has agreed to use the company as the exclusive vehicle for its U.S. media and entertainment investments, the company said. The company said Qintex's U.S. subsidiary also agreed to supply a minimum 70 mln dlrs line of credit to the new company, which shall be used, with Qintex approval, for financing new HRI products. The company said that under the definitive agreement, Qintex's U.S. division will have the right to purchase up to 51 pct of the new company in the open market, in private transactions or by tender offer, but will not be purchasing warrants to bring its ownership to 51 pct of the new company. If Qintex's U.S. subsidiary has not achieved this ownership within one year after the completion of the merger, the subsidiary will have the right two years thereafter to request that HRI commence a rights offering to HRI stockholders, the company said. Regarding the potential rights offering, Qintex's U.S. subsidiary will act as standby purchaser, the company said. The transaction is subject to the approval of both company's shareholders, the receipt of certain tax approvals, and the continued employement of Robert Halmi Sr and Robert Halmi Jr, the company said. Robert Halmi Sr, who is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Robert Halmi Inc, will be chairman of the new company and David Evans, current president and chief operating officer of Hal Roach, will become chief executive, the company said.

            "BODY": "The Louvre accord on currency stability, which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February, appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil, foreign exchange dealers said. But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates. \"That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,\" Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S. Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord. \"The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation,\" Chris Johns, currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view, telling Reuters that \"the exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on.\" French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for \"a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\" Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord.\" In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S. Was still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates, injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct. "

In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the Belzberg families of Canada. The complaint also discloses that on each occasion, Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures. Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be determined. In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it reportedly owns, the suit said. According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full benefits of the company's restructuring. In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S. consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Industrial Equity (Pacific) did not disclose details of the proposal, but said it would be delivered to Calmat in the near future. Industrial Equity (Pacific) \"does not intend to remain a passive investor\" in Calmat, the firm told the SEC. In its SEC filing, Industrial Equity (Pacific) said its president of North American operations Ronald Langley met with Calmat officials on October 14 to discuss an acquisition of the company at a premium over the market price of Calmat stock. Industrial Equity (Pacific) added it is considering launching a tender offer for Calmat stock or making a merger proposal to the company, but said it has not decided whether it will pursue a Calmat acquisition on a non-negotiated basis. Industrial Equity (Pacific), which currently holds 5.83 mln Calmat common shares, said it is also evaluating the company's recently adopted shareholder rights plan and its potential effect on Calmat and on possible acquisition proposals made to the company. Between October 2 and 14, Industrial Equity (Pacific) bought 918,900 shares of Calmat common stock at 33 dlrs to 37.55 dlrs a share, or a total of about 33.8 mln dlrs. "

            "BODY": "The official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration. Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels. \"The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration,\" Krutikhin said. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs. Soviet officials have previously criticized the United States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their presence serves to increase tension. Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year. Krutikhin said: \"The United States has undertaken an act of armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has long been spoken of by Washington officials.\" "

The company said the offer is being made under a definitive agreement reached with the new company, IDC Acquisition Corp, formed by Apollo Partners Ltd and investment clients of <Equitable Capital Management Inc>. The agreement calls for the acquisition of IDC for about 62.4 mln dlrs. IDC Acquisition will also tender for all of IDC's outstanding nine pct convertible subordinated debentures. IDC said the merger agreement also provides for payment of an equivalent amount in respect of employee stock options to be cancelled in the merger. As part of the transaction, the company said, it granted IDC Acquisition an option to acquire up to 20 pct of the company's outstanding shares for 16 dlrs per share. It said the planned tender offer is subject to several conditions, including the tendering of over 50 pct of the company's outstanding stock. MIM Holdings Ltd <MIMA.S>, a substantial shareholder in IDC, has agreed it will not buy any additional IDC shares until February seven and has granted IDC Acquisition a right of first refusal on any IDC shares it sells during that period, the company said. It said Apollo Partners was recently organized by three former senior Viacom Inc <VIA> executives, Terrence A. Elkes, George C. Catell and Kenneth F. Gorman. "

To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on consumer goods and services, the company will give serious consideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace and defense company, if it can realize a price which will return maximum value to shareholders. In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs. IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and services field. The company said it authorized a program to repurchase between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stock from time to time when conditions warrant. It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs. An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved \"across-the-board\" cuts rather than specific about targeted areas. IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the company's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad to shareholders. The company's other major subsidiaries are Pet Inc, Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers, Midas International Corp and Hussmann Corp. "

Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said considerable progress has been made by the group towards fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed countries. The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion. He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a determination to resist the currently strong protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress. "

In exchange for the Cable and Wireless Hong Kong capital, Hong Kong Telecommunications will issue 4.18 billion new shares to Cable and Wireless Plc's Cable and Wireless (Far East) Ltd. That subsidiary now holds the group's 80 pct stake in Cable and Wireless Hong Kong and about 22 pct of H.K. Telephone. It will issue an additional 1.05 billion shares to the goverment. That will leave the Cable and Wireless group with an 80 pct stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications, the government 11 pct and nine pct in public hands.

In a letter to the committee of independent directors formed to consider the offer, Heyman said it will have to modify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due to rising interest rates and financial market conditions. Heyman said \"In the considerable time that has elapsed since our original proposal was submitted, the credit and financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost unprecedented deterioration. As of the present time, the average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points.\" He said the group intends to promptly review all available options, including the revision of its offer to reflect current market conditions.

The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles) from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the Gulf of Aden, MEES said. MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity. The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.

The pound closed on Thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00. Association sources told Reuters Friday's suspension of trading for two working days was continued on Monday for two more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound. The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in east and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week. The pound, hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil war, has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this year. "

Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier A/S <KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said. Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S <AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig. Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several months earlier than previously planned. Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km west of Bergen. Statoil estimates the field's total development cost, including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas. Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields. Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55 pct share, <Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), <Deminex (Norge) A/S> (13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S <NHY.OL> (nine pct) and <Svenska Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).

The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged dollar slide. The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month. But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was \"not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.\" \"What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow them,\" he added.

            "BODY": "The Soviet Union has agreed to supply Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said. IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said. Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union. Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf. Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow. Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products. Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran. "
